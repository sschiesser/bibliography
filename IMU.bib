abstract = {Measurements from magnetometers and inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) can be combined to give 3D orientation estimates. In order to obtain accurate orientation estimates it is imperative that the magnetometer and inertial sensor axes are aligned and that the magnetometer is properly calibrated for both sensor errors as well as presence of magnetic distortions. In this work we derive an easy-to-use calibration algorithm that can be used to calibrate a combination of a magnetometer and inertial sensors. The algorithm compensates for any static magnetic distortions created by the sensor plat- form, magnetometer sensor errors and determines the alignment between the magnetometer and the inertial sensor axes. The resulting calibration procedure does not require any additional hardware. We make use of probabilistic models and obtain the calibration algorithm as the solution to a maximum likelihood problem. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using experimental data collected from a sensor unit placed in a magnetically disturbed environment onboard a jet aircraft.},

abstract = {Until recently the weight and size of inertial sensors has prohibited their use in domains such as human motion capture. Recent improvements in the performance of small and lightweight micro- machined electromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensors have made the application of inertial techniques to such problems possible. This has resulted in an increased interest in the topic of inertial navigation, however current introductions to the subject fail to sufficiently describe the error characteristics of inertial systems. We introduce inertial navigation, focusing on strapdown systems based on MEMS devices. A com- bination of measurement and simulation is used to explore the error characteristics of such systems. For a simple inertial navigation system (INS) based on the Xsens Mtx inertial measurement unit (IMU), we show that the average error in position grows to over 150 m after 60 seconds of operation. The propagation of orientation errors caused by noise perturbing gyroscope signals is identified as the critical cause of such drift. By simulation we examine the significance of individual noise processes perturbing the gyroscope signals, identifying white noise as the process which contributes most to the overall drift of the system. Sensor fusion and domain specific constraints can be used to reduce drift in INSs. For an example INS we show that sensor fusion using magnetometers can reduce the average error in position obtained by the system after 60 seconds from over 150 m to around 5 m. We conclude that whilst MEMS IMU technology is rapidly improving, it is not yet possible to build a MEMS based INS which gives sub-meter position accuracy for more than one minute of operation.},

abstract = {This paper presents design and implementation of a drift-free orientation tracker for head-mounted displays. The sensor consists of a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyro, and a 3- axis magnetometer. A digital motion processor is also used. To remove gyro drifts in the long run, a sensor fusion method is applied that combines accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer data. Before this data fusion, bias removal of accelerometer and calibration of magnetometer are carried out. The results of this sensor fusion are given to a virtual camera for real-time graphical rendering of the virtual environment. This program shows updates virtual images of the head-mounted display with 33 frames per second. The results show that the drift of gyro is reduced to less than 1.0 degrees over 3 minutes},

@article{Kok2017a,
abstract = {Abstract In recent years, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensors (3D accelerometers and 3D gyroscopes) have become widely available due to their small size and low cost. Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suffer from inte- gration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and filtering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman filter and complementary filter implementations. The quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated data.},
