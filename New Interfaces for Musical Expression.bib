abstract = {This paper describes the development of an Apple iPhone based mobile computersystem for vibraphone and its use in a series of the author's performanceprojects in 2011 and 2012.This artistic research was motivated by a desire to develop an alternative tolaptop computers for the author's existing percussion and computer performancepractice. The aims were to develop a light, compact and flexible system usingmobile devices that would allow computer music to infiltrate solo and ensembleperformance situations where it is difficult to use a laptop computer.The project began with a system that brought computer elements to NordligVinter, a suite of percussion duos, using an iPhone, RjDj, Pure Data and ahome-made pickup system. This process was documented with video recordings andanalysed using ethnographic methods.The mobile computer music setup proved to be elegant and convenient inperformance situations with very little time and space to set up, as well as inperformance classes and workshops. The simple mobile system encouragedexperimentation and the platforms used enabled sharing with a wider audience.},

Inorder to show the principles and reflections that informed the choices made indeveloping this syllabus, fundamental elements of an instrument-bodyrelationship and the perceptual import of sensori-motor integration areinvestigated. The methods used to let participants learn in practicalexperimental settings are discussed, showing a way to conceptualise andexperience the entire workflow from instrumental sound to electronictransformations by blending gestural interaction with digital musicalinstrument techniques and traditional instrumental playing skills. Thetechnical interfaces and software that were deployed are explained, focussingof the interactive potential offered by each solution. In an attempt tosummarise and evaluate the impact of this course, a number of insights relatingto this specific pedagogical situation are put forward. Finally, concreteexamples of interactive situations that were developed by the participants areshown in order to demonstrate the validity of this approach.},

abstract = {SoundStrand is a tangible music composition tool. It demonstrates a paradigm developed to enable music composition through the use of tangible interfaces. This paradigm attempts to overcome the contrast between the relatively small of amount degrees of freedom usually demonstrated by tangible interfaces and the vast number of possibilities that musical composition presents.
SoundStrand is comprised of a set of physical objects called cells, each representing a musical phrase. Cells can be sequentially connected to each other to create a musical theme. Cells can also be physically manipulated to access a wide range of melodic, rhythmic and harmonic variations. The SoundStrand software assures that as the cells are manipulated, the melodic flow, harmonic transitions and rhythmic patterns of the theme remain musically plausible while preserving the user's intentions.},

abstract = {So far, there are few studies of string instruments with bows because there aremany parameters to acquire skills and it is difficult to measure theseparameters. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a design of alearning environment for a novice learner to acquire an accurate fingerposition skill. For achieving the aim, we developed a learning environmentwhich can diagnose learner's finger position and give the learner advice byusing magnetic position sensors. The system shows three windows; a fingerposition window for visualization of finger position, a score window fordiagnosing finger position along the score and command prompt window forshowing states of system and advices. Finally, we evaluated the system by anexperiment. The experimental group improved accuracy values about fingerpositions and also improved accuracy of pitches of sounds compared withcontrol group. These results shows significant differences.},

The software maps soundaround the edges and responds to the user's gestural input,allowing both aural and haptic modes of interaction as well asdirect manipulation of media content. The software is designedto be very flexible and can be adapted to a wide range ofshapes. Our tests of the A20's perceptual and interactionproperties showed that users can successfully detect soundplacement, movement and haptic effects on this device. Ourparticipatory design workshops explored the possibilities of theA20 as a generative tool for the design of an extended,collaborative personal music player.

abstract = {This paper describes the conceptualization and development of an open source tool for controlling the sound of a saxophone via the gestures of its performer. The motivation behind this work is the need for easy access tools to explore, compose and perform electroacoustic music in Colombian music schools and conservatories. This work led to the adaptation of common hardware to be used as a sensor attached to an acoustic instrument and the development of software applications to record, visualize and map performers gesture data into signal processing parameters. The scope of this work suggested that focus was to be made on a specific instrument so the saxophone was chosen. Gestures were selected in an iterative process with the performer, although a more ambitious strategy to figure out main gestures of an instruments performance was first defined. Detailed gesture-to-sound processing mappings are exposed in the text. An electroacoustic musical piece was successfully rehearsed and recorded using the Gest-O system.},

abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced sonic data communication method using TAPIR (Theoretically Audible, but Practically Inaudible Range: frequencies above 18kHz) sound and a software toolkit as its implementation. Using inaudible sound as a data medium, a digital data network among the audience and performer can be easily built with microphones and speakers, without requiring any additional hardware. ``TAPIR Sound Tag" is a smart device framework for inaudible data communication that can be easily embedded in audience participatory performances and interactive arts. With a bandwidth of 900 Hz, a high transmission rate of 200 bps can be achieved, enabling peer-to-peer or broadcasting real-time data communication among smart devices. This system can be used without any advanced knowledge in signal processing and communication system theory; simply specifying carrier frequency and bandwidth with a few lines of code can start data communication. Several usage scenarios of the system are also presented, such as participating in an interactive performance by adding and controlling sound, and collaborative completion of an artist's work by audience. We expect this framework to provide a new way of audience interaction to artists, as well as further promoting audience participation by simplifying the process: using personal smart devices as a medium and not requiring additional hardware or complex settings.},

The electronic chanter employs a robust and responsive infrared (IR) sensing strategy, and uses audio samples from acoustic recordings to produce a high quality bagpipe sound. Moreover, the continuous nature of the IR sensors offers the controller a considerable degree of flexibility, indicating sig- nificant potential for the inclusion of extended and novel techniques for musical expression in the future.},

The initial pitch estimate is then used to restrict the search space of an audio pitch tracking algorithm. Most audio-only pitch tracking algorithms face a fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and latency, with longer analysis windows producing better pitch estimates at the cost of noticeable lag in a live performance environment. Conversely, sensor-only strategies struggle to achieve the fine pitch accuracy a human listener would expect. By combining the two approaches, high accuracy and low latency can be simultaneously achieved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a minimally-invasive, wireless optical sensorsystem for use with any conventional piston valve acoustic trumpet. Itis designed to be easy to install and remove by any trumpeter. Ourgoal is to offer the extended control afforded by hyperinstrumentswithout the hard to reverse or irreversible invasive modificationsthat are typically used for adding digital sensing capabilities. Weutilize optical sensors to track the continuous position displacementvalues of the three trumpet valves. These values are trasmittedwirelessly and can be used by an external controller. The hardware hasbeen designed to be reconfigurable by having the housing 3D printed sothat the dimensions can be adjusted for any particular trumpetmodel. The result is a low cost, low power, easily replicable sensorsolution that offers any trumpeter the ability to augment their ownexisting trumpet without compromising the instrument's structure orplaying technique. The extended digital control afforded by our systemis interweaved with the natural playing gestures of an acoustictrumpet. We believe that this seemless integration is critical forenabling effective and musical human computer interaction.Keywords: hyperinstrument, trumpet, minimally-invasive, gesture sensing,wireless, I2C},

abstract = {The Chimaera is a touch-less, expressive, polyphonic and electronic music controller based on magnetic field sensing. An array of hall-effect sensors and their vicinity make up a continuous 2D interaction space. The sensors are excited with Neodymium magnets worn on fingers. The device continuously tracks position and vicinity of multiple present magnets along the sensor array to produce event signals accordingly. Apart from the two positional signals, an event also carries the magnetic field polarization, a unique identifier and group association. We like to think of it as a mixed analog/digital offspring of theremin and trautonium. These general-purpose event signals are transmitted and eventually translated into musical events according to custom mappings on a host system. With its touch-less control (no friction), high update rates (2-4kHz), its quasi-continuous spatial resolution and its low-latency ({\textless}1 ms), the Chimaera can react to most subtle motions instantaneously and allows for a highly dynamic and expressive play. Its open source design additionally gives the user all possibilities to further tune hardware and firmware to his or her needs. The Chimaera is network-oriented and configured with and communicated by OSC (Open Sound Control), which makes it straight-forward to integrate into any setup.},

Participants can easily create simple sound compositions in real time by collaboratively operating physical artifacts as sound controllers. The physical configuration of the artifacts requires coordinated actions between participants to control sound (thus requiring, and emphasizing collaboration).
Simpletones encourages playful human-to-human interaction by introducing a simple interface and a set of basic rules [1]. This enables novices to focus on the collaborative aspects of making music as a group (such as synchronization and taking collective decisions through non-verbal communication) to ultimately engage a state of group flow[2].
This project is relevant to a contemporary discourse on musical expression because it allows novices to experience the social aspects of group music making, something that is usually reserved only for trained performers [3].},

There were marked differences between the groups regarding focus, in that the participants in blindfolded group tended to focus on fewer aspects, have a heightened focus and be less distracted than the seeing group. The seeing group, on its part, focused more on the technological instruments applied in the performance, the performer herself and her actions. This study also shows that there were only minor differences between the groups regarding the experience of skill and control, and argues that this observation can be explained by earlier research on skill in NIMEs.},

abstract = {In the design of recent systems, I have advanced techniques that positiongraphic synthesis methods in the context of solo, improvisational performance.Here, the primary interfaces for musical action are prepared works on paper,scanned by digital video cameras which in turn pass image data on to softwarefor analysis and interpretation as sound synthesis and signal processingprocedures. The focus of this paper is on one of these techniques, a process Idescribe as graphic waveshaping. A discussion of graphic waveshaping in basicform and as utilized in my performance work, (title omitted), is offered. Inthe latter case, the performer's objective is to guide the interpretation ofimages as sound, constantly tuning and retuning the conversion while selectingand scanning images from a large catalog. Due to the erratic nature of thesystem and the precondition that image to sound relationships are unfixed, theperformance situation is replete with the discovery of new sounds and thecircumstances that bring them into play. Graphic waveshaping may be understood as non-linear distortion synthesis withtime-varying transfer functions stemming from visual scan lines. As a form ofgraphic synthesis, visual images function as motivations for sound generation.There is a strategy applied for creating one out of the other. However, counterto compositionally oriented forms of graphic synthesis where one may assignimage characteristics to musical parameters such as pitches, durations,dynamics, etc., graphic waveshaping is foremost a processing technique, as itdistorts incoming signals according to graphically derived transfer functions.As such, it may also be understood as an audio effect; one that in myimplementations is particularly feedback dependent, oriented towards shapingthe erratic behavior of synthesis patches written in Max/MSP/Jitter. Used inthis manner, graphic waveshaping elicits an emergent system behaviorconditioned by visual features.},

abstract = {Sound generators and synthesis engines expose a large set of parameters, allowing run-time timbre morphing and exploration of sonic space. However, control over these high-dimensional interfaces is constrained by the physical limitations of performers. In this paper we propose the exploitation of vocal gesture as an extension or alternative to traditional physical controllers. The approach uses dynamic aspects of vocal sound to control variations in the timbre of the synthesized sound. The mapping from vocal to synthesis parameters is automatically adapted to information extracted from vocal examples as well as to the relationship between parameters and timbre within the synthesizer. The mapping strategy aims to maximize the breadth of the explorable perceptual sonic space over a set of the synthesizer's real-valued parameters, indirectly driven by the voice-controlled interface.},

However, the visualisation and triggeringof lights is normally scripted in advance and synchronised with the concert,severely limiting the artist's freedom for improvisation, expression and ad-hocadaptation of their show. These scripts result in performances where thetechnology enforces the artist and their music to stay in synchronisation withthe pre-programmed environment. We argue that these limitations can be overcomebased on emerging non-invasive tracking technologies in combination with anadvanced gesture recognition engine.We present a solution that uses explicit gestures and implicit dance moves tocontrol the visual augmentation of a live music performance. We furtherillustrate how our framework overcomes existing limitations of gestureclassification systems by delivering a precise recognition solution based on asingle gesture sample in combination with expert knowledge. The presentedsolution enables a more dynamic and spontaneous performance and, when combinedwith indirect augmented reality, results in a more intense interaction betweenthe artist and their audience.},

Our research seeks to overcome such obstacles by minimizing the code needed to both generate and read the output of interfaces on mobile devices. For iOS and Android devices, our implementation extends the application Control to use a simple set of OSC messages to define interfaces and automatically route output. On the desktop, our implementations in Max/MSP/Jitter, LuaAV, and Su- perCollider allow users to create mobile widgets mapped to sonic parameters with a single line of code. We believe the fluidity of our approach will encourage users to incorporate mobile devices into their everyday performance practice.},

These interfaces work well when the movement and sound are smooth and continuous, but it has proven difficult to design a system which triggers discrete sounds with precision that allows for complex rhythmic performance. We conducted a study where participants perform ``air-drumming" gestures in time to rhythmic sounds. These movements are recorded, and the timing of various movement features with respect to the onset of audio events is analyzed. A novel algorithm for detecting sudden changes in direction is used to find the end of the strike gesture. We find that these occur on average after the audio onset and that this timing varies with the tempo of the movement. Sharp peaks in magnitude acceleration occur before the audio onset and do not vary with tempo. These results suggest that detecting peaks in acceleration will lead to more naturally responsive air gesture instruments.},

abstract = {Two related versions of an unstable live algorithm for the Disklavier player piano are presented. The underlying gen- erative feedback system consists of four virtual musicians, listening to each other in a circular configuration. There is no temporal form, and all parameters of the system are controlled by the performer through an intricate but direct mapping, in an attempt to combine the experienced mu- sician's physical control of gesture and phrasing, with the structural complexities and richness of generative music. In the first version, Circle Squared, the interface is an array of pressure sensors, and the performer performs on the sys- tem without participating directly, like a puppet master. In the second version, control parameters are derived directly from playing on the same piano that performs the output of the system. Here, the performer both plays with and on the system in an intricate dance with the unpredictable output of the unstable virtual ensemble. The underlying mapping strategies are presented, together with the struc- ture of the generative system. Experiences from a series of performances are discussed, primarily from the perspective of the improvising musician.},

abstract = {We present an interactive content-based MIR environment specifically designedto aid in the exploration of databases of experimental electronic music,particularly in cases where little or no metadata exist. In recent years,several rare archives of early experimental electronic music have becomeavailable. The Daphne Oram Collection contains one such archive, consisting ofapproximately 120 hours of 1/4 inch tape recordings and representing a perioddating from circa 1957. This collection is recognized as an importantmusicological resource, representing aspects of the evolution of electronicmusic practices, including early tape editing methods, experimental synthesistechniques and composition. However, it is extremely challenging to derivemeaningful information from this dataset, primarily for three reasons. First,the dataset is very large. Second, there is limited metadata - some titles,track lists, and occasional handwritten notes exist, but where this is true,the reliability of the annotations are unknown. Finally, and mostsignificantly, as this is a collection of early experimental electronic music,the sonic characteristics of the material are often not consistent withtraditional musical information. In other words, there is no score, no knowninstrumentation, and often no recognizable acoustic source. We present amethod for the construction of a frequency component dictionary derived fromthe collection via Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA), anddemonstrate how an interactive 3D visualization of the relationships betweenthe PLCA-derived dictionary and the archive is facilitating researcher'sunderstanding of the data.},

abstract = {The El-Lamellophone (El-La) is a Lamellophone hyperinstrument incorporating electronic sensors and integrated DSP. Initial investigations have been made into digitallycontrolled physical actuation of the acoustic tines. An embedded Linux micro-computer supplants the laptop. A piezoelectric pickup is mounted to the underside of the body of the instrument for direct audio acquisition providing a robust signal with little interference. The signal is used for electric sound-reinforcement, creative signal processing and audio analysis developed in Puredata (Pd). This signal inputs and outputs the micro computer via stereo 1/8th inch phono jacks. Sensors provide gesture recognition affording the performer a broader, more dynamic range of musical human computer interaction (MHCI) over specific DSP functions. Work has been done toward electromagnetic actuation of the tines, aiming to allow performer control and sensation via both traditional Lamellophone techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared human/computer control of the resulting sound. The goal is to achieve this without compromising the traditional sound production methods of the acoustic instrument while leveraging inherent performance gestures with embedded continuous controller values essential to MHCI. The result is an intuitive, performer designed, hybrid electro-acoustic instrument, idiomatic computer interface, and robotic acoustic instrument in one framework.},

In the proposed system, we do not make use of symbolic data such as MIDI, but acquire a real-time audio input from on-board microphone of smartphone. Then, the system finds onset and pitch of the note from the signal, to align this information with the ground truth musical score. Real-time alignment allows the system to evaluate whether the user played the correct note or not, regardless of its timing, which enables user to play at their own speed, as playing same tempo with original musical score is problematic for beginners. As an output of evaluation, the system notifies the user about which part they are currently performing, and which note were played incorrectly.},

Depending on the interface and the complexity of the software used as a transition between the controller and sound, a musician performance can be totally opaque for the audience and loose its interest. This paper examines the possibility of adding a visual feedback to help the public understanding, and add expressivity to the performance. It explores the various mapping organizations between controller and sound, giving different spaces of representation for the visual feedback. It can be either an amplification of the controller parameters, or a representation of the related musical parameters. Different examples of visualization are presented and evaluated, taking the Cantor Digitalis as a support. It appears the representation of musical parameters, little used compared to the representation of controllers, received a good opinion from the audience, highlighting the musical intention of the performers.},

We evaluate the drum using a synthesized frequency sweep, and find that the instrument has a broad frequency response and exhibits qualities of both a drum and speaker.},

It does not provide a theoreticalframework within which we can analyze different scheduling protocols and theirimpact on the DMI's performance. Indeed, the mapping between the DMI's sensoryinputs and sonic outputs is classically treated as a black box. DMI designersand builders are forced to design and schedule the flow of data through thisblack box on their own. Improper design of the data flow can produceundesirable results, ranging from overflowing buffers that cause system crashesto misaligned sensory data that result in strange or disordered sonic events.In this paper, we attempt to remedy this problem by providing a framework forthe design and analysis of the DMI data flow. We also provide a schedulingalgorithm built upon that framework that guarantees desirable properties forthe resulting DMI.},

A new approach creates a personalized on-screen slider that lets the user manipulate the audio in terms of a descriptive term (e.g. "warm"), without the user needing to learn or use the interface of an equalizer. This system learns mappings by presenting a sequence of sounds to the user and correlating the gain in each frequency band with the user's preference rating. The system speeds learning through transfer learning. Results on a study of 35 participants show how an effective, personalized audio manipulation tool can be automatically built after only three ratings from the user.},

This paper (a) identifies a number of fundamental human eye movement capabilities and constraints which determine in part what can and cannot be musically expressed with eye movements, (b) reviews prior work on eye-controlled musical expression, and (c) analyzes and provides a taxonomy of what has been done, and what will need to be addressed in future eye-controlled musical instruments. The fundamental human constraints and processes that govern eye movements create a challenge for eye-controlled music in that the instrument needs to be designed to motivate or at least permit specific unique visual goals, each of which when accomplished must then be mapped, using the eye tracker and some sort of sound generator, to different musical outcomes. The control of the musical instrument is less direct than if it were played with muscles that can be controlled in a more direct manner, such as the muscles in the hands.},

A framewise chroma distribution over an entire musical piece is a useful and straightforward representation of its musical pitch over time. This paper examines a method of condensing the block-wise chroma information of a musical piece into a two dimensional embedding. Such an embedding is a representation or map of the different pitched energies in a song, and how these energies relate to each other in the context of the song. The paper presents an interactive version of this representation as an exploratory analytical tool or instrument for granular synthesis. Pointing and clicking on the interactive map recreates the acoustical energy present in the chroma blocks at that location, providing an effective way of both exploring the relationships between sounds in the original piece, and recreating a synthesized approximation of these sounds in an instrumental fashion. },

Each ring contains a small, independently controlled exciter transducer commonly used for auditory bone conduction. The rings sound loudly when they touch a hard object, and are practically silent otherwise. When a wearer touches their own (or someone else's) head, the contacted person hears the sound through bone conduction, inaudible to others. The bracelet contains a microcontroller, a set of FET transistors, an accelerometer, and a battery. The microcontroller generates a separate audio signal for each ring, switched through the FETs, and can take user input through the accelerometer in the form of taps, flicks, and other gestures. The player controls the envelope and timbre of the sound by varying the physical pressure and the angle of their finger on the surface, or by touching differently resonant surfaces. Because its sound is shaped by direct, physical contact with objects and people, the FingerSynth encourages players to experiment with the materials around them and with one another, making music with everything they touch.},

The primary goal of this study was to determine how players' actions changed when moving from an acoustic instrument like the tom drum, to a gestural controller like the Buchla Lightning, which bears little resemblance to an acoustic percussion instrument. Motion capture data was analyzed by comparing a subject's hand height variability and timing accuracy across the four instruments as they performed simple musical tasks. Results suggest that certain gestures such as hand height amplitude can be adapted to these gestural controllers with little change and that in general subjects' timing variability is significantly affected when playing on the Lightning and Radio Baton when compared to the more familiar tom drum and VDrum. Possible explanations and other observations are also presented. },

Digital sound generation is typically controlled by a large number of parameters and efficient and flexible mapping is necessary to provide expressive control over the instrument. The proposed modulation matrix technique may be seen as a generic and selfmodifying mapping mechanism integrated in a dynamic interpolation scheme. It is implemented efficiently by taking advantage of its inherent sparse matrix structure. The modulation matrix is used within the Hadron Particle Synthesizer, a complex granular module with 200 synthesis parameters and a simplified performance control structure with 4 expression parameters. },

Second, through this instrument we wanted to provide an alternative to the view that you become a hero by perfect imitation of your idols. Instead, play yourself. You are the hero. In this paper, we describe the design of the instrument, including its novel mapping approach based on switched timbre vectors scaled by accellerometer data, unconventional sound engines and the sound and mapping editing features, including manual editing of individual vectors. The instrument is evaluated through its practical applications during the whole project, with workshops with teenagers, a set of state-funded commissions from professional composers, and the development of considerable skill by the key performers. We have also submitted a performance proposal for this project.},

Technical barriers still persist that limit this activity to exclusive groups capable of learning skillsets far removed from one's musical craft. These skills include programming, soldering, microprocessors, wireless protocols, and circuit design. Those of us whose creative activity is centered in NIME have to become polyglots of many disciplines to achieve our work. In the NIME community, it's unclear that we should even draw distinctions between 'artist' and 'technician', because these skillsets have become integral to our creative practice. However, what about the vast communities of musicians, composers, and artists who want to leverage sensing to take their craft into new territory with no background in circuits, soldering, embedded programming, and sensor function? eMersion, a plug-and-play, modular, wireless alternative solution for creating NIMEs will be presented. It enables one to bypass the technical hurdles listed above in favor of immediate experimentation with musical practice and wireless sensing. A unique software architecture will also be unveiled that enables one to quickly and intuitively process and map unpredictable numbers and types of wireless data streams, the Digital Data Workstation.},

abstract = {This paper explores the challenge of achieving nuanced control and physical engagement with gestural interfaces in performance. Performances with a prototype gestural performance system, Gestate, provide the basis for insights into the application of gestural systems in live contexts. These reflections stem from a performer's perspective, outlining the experience of prototyping and performing with augmented instruments that extend vocal or instrumental technique through ancillary gestures. Successful implementation of rapidly evolving gestural technologies in real-time performance calls for new approaches to performing and musicianship, centred around a growing understanding of the body's physical and creative potential. For musicians hoping to incorporate gestural control seamlessly into their performance practice a balance of technical mastery and kinaesthetic awareness is needed to adapt existing systems to their own purposes. Within non-tactile systems, visual feedback mechanisms can support this process by providing explicit visual cues that compensate for the absence of haptic or tangible feedback. Experience gained through prototyping and performance can yield a deeper understanding of the broader nature of gestural control and the way in which performers inhabit their own bodies.},

At present, this kind of interfaces present at least some of the following charac- teristics that limit their musical use: latency in the inter- action, and partial or complete lack of responsiveness to gestures such as tapping, scrubbing or pressing force. Our current research is exploring ways of improving the quality of interaction with this kind of interfaces, and in particular with the tangible tabletop instrument Reactable . In this paper we present a system based on a circular array of me- chanically intercoupled force sensing resistors used to obtain a low-latency, affordable, and easily embeddable hardware system able to detect surface impacts and pressures on the tabletop perimeter. We also consider the option of com- pleting this detected gestural information with the sound information coming from a contact microphone attached to the mechanical coupling layer, to control physical modelling synthesis of percussion instruments.},

abstract = {In the design of recent systems, I have advanced techniques that positiongraphic synthesis methods in the context of solo, improvisational performance.Here, the primary interfaces for musical action are prepared works on paper,scanned by digital video cameras which in turn pass image data on to softwarefor analysis and interpretation as sound synthesis and signal processingprocedures. The focus of this paper is on one of these techniques, a process Idescribe as graphic waveshaping. A discussion of graphic waveshaping in basicform and as utilized in my performance work, (title omitted), is offered. Inthe latter case, the performer's objective is to guide the interpretation ofimages as sound, constantly tuning and retuning the conversion while selectingand scanning images from a large catalog. Due to the erratic nature of thesystem and the precondition that image to sound relationships are unfixed, theperformance situation is replete with the discovery of new sounds and thecircumstances that bring them into play. Graphic waveshaping may be understood as non-linear distortion synthesis withtime-varying transfer functions stemming from visual scan lines. As a form ofgraphic synthesis, visual images function as motivations for sound generation.There is a strategy applied for creating one out of the other. However, counterto compositionally oriented forms of graphic synthesis where one may assignimage characteristics to musical parameters such as pitches, durations,dynamics, etc., graphic waveshaping is foremost a processing technique, as itdistorts incoming signals according to graphically derived transfer functions.As such, it may also be understood as an audio effect; one that in myimplementations is particularly feedback dependent, oriented towards shapingthe erratic behavior of synthesis patches written in Max/MSP/Jitter. Used inthis manner, graphic waveshaping elicits an emergent system behaviorconditioned by visual features.},

The tools provide a means for composers working in the Pure Data composition environment to design and audition performances using ensembles of mobile phones. These tools were developed as part of a larger project motivated by the desire to allow large groups of non-expert players to perform music based on just intonation using ubiquitous technology. The paper discusses the process that replicates a Pure Data patch so that it will operate within the hardware and software constraints of the Java 2 Micro Edition. It also describes development of objects that will enable mobile phone performances to be simulated accurately in PD and to audition microtonal tuning implemented using MIDI in the j2me environment. These tools eliminate the need for composers to compose for mobile phones by writing java code. In a single desktop application, they offer the composer the flexibility to write music for multiple phones. },

They have, however, seldom been used in this area, so this paper explores their possible uses. This project contributes a new open source library, which was developed to allow ESNs to run in the Pure Data dataflow environment. Several use cases were explored, focusing on addressing current issues in mapping research. ESNs were found to work successfully in scenarios of pattern classification, multiparametric control, explorative mapping and the design of nonlinearities and uncontrol. $\backslash$emph{\{}Un-trained{\}} behaviours are proposed, as augmentations to the conventional reservoir system that allow the player to introduce potentially interesting non-linearities and uncontrol into the reservoir. Interactive evolution style controls are proposed as strategies to help design these behaviours, which are otherwise dependent on arbitrary parameters. A study on sound classification shows that ESNs can reliably differentiate between two drum sounds, and also generalise to other similar input. Following evaluation of the use cases, heuristics are proposed to aid the use of ESNs in computer music scenarios.},

Digital vinyl systems combine the distinct haptic nature of the analog turntable with the advantages of digital media. They use special records containing a digital timecode which is then processed by a computer and mapped to properties like playback speed and direction. These records, however, are generic and, in contrast to traditional vinyl, do not provide visual cues representing the structure of the track. We present a system that augments the timecode record with a visualization of song information such as artist, title, and track length, but also with a waveform that allows to visually navigate to a certain beat. We conducted a survey examining the acceptance of such tools in the DJ community and conducted a user study with professional DJs. The system was widely accepted as a tool in the DJ community and received very positive feedback during observational mixing sessions with four professional DJs.},

By using the movement classification result not as a direct control action in itself, but as a way to change mapping spaces and musical sections, the control possibilities offered by the simple interface are greatly increased.},

Although there are many opportunities to shape the amplitude envelope before loudspeaker amplification, they are all governed by the ever-decaying physical vibra- tions of the tone generating mechanism. A single-note proof of concept for electromagnetic control over this vibrating mechanism was presented at NIME 2011.
In the past year, virtually every aspect of the system has been improved. We use a different vibration sensor that is immune to electromagnetic interference, thus eliminat- ing troublesome feedback. For control, we both reduce cost and gain continuous position sensing throughout the entire range of key motion in addition to aftertouch pressure. Finally, the entire system now fits within the space constraints presented by the original piano, allowing it to be installed on adjacent notes.},

abstract = {According to the tradition, music ensembles are usually lead by a conductor who is the responsible to coordinate and guide the group under a specific musical criteria. Similarly, computer ensembles resort to a conductor to keep the synchronization and structural coordination of the performance, often with the assistance of software. Achieving integration and coherence in a networked performance, however, can be challenging in certain scenarios. This is the case for configurations with a high degree of mutual interdependence and shared control. This paper focuses on the design strategies for developing a software based conductor assistant for collective instruments. We propose a novel conductor dimension space representation for collective instruments, which takes into account both its social and structural features. We present a case study of a collective instrument implementing a software conductor. Finally, we discuss the implications of human and machine conduction schemes in the context of the proposed dimension space.},

abstract = {Pop music jamming on the keyboard requires massive music knowledge. Musician needs to understand and memorize the behavior of each chord in different keys. However, most simple pop music follows a common chord progression pattern. This pattern applies to most simple pop music on all the 12 keys. We designed an app that can reduce the difficulty of music jamming on the keyboard by using this pattern. The app displays the current chord in the Roman numeral and suggests the expected next chord in an easy to understand way on a smartphone. This work investigates into the human computer interaction perspective of music performance. We use a smartphone app as a bridge, which assists musician to react faster in music jamming by transforming the complex music knowledge into a simple, unified and easy to understand format. Experiment result shows that this app can help the non-keyboardist musician to learn pop music jamming. It also shows that the app is useful to assist keyboardist in making key transpose and playing music in the key with many sharps and flats. We will use the same interface design to guide user on playing other chord progressions such as the jazz chord progression.},

Despite offering rich and robust data output and multiple ways to interpret it, approaches towards using multi-touch technology in digit al musical inst rument design have been markedly conservative, showing a strong tendency towards modeling existing hardware. This not only negates many of the benefits of multi-touch technology but also creates specific difficulties in the context of live music performance. A case study of two other interface types that have seen considerable musical use -- the XY pad and button grid -- illustrates the manner in which the implicit characteristics of a device determine the conditions under which it will favorably perform. Accordingly, this paper proposes an alternative approach to multi-touch which emp hasizes the imp licit strengths of the technology and establishes a philosophy of design around them. Finally, we introduce two toolkits currently being used to assess the validity of this approach.},

The dome, circular speaker and circular seating arrangements provide means for skilled composers and performers to create a virtual reality in which attendees are immersed in the composite instrument. This initial foray into designing an audio-visual computerbased instrument for improvisational performance in a planetarium builds on prior, successful work in mapping the rules and state of two-dimensional computer board games to improvised computer music. The unique visual and audio geometries of the planetarium present challenges and opportunities. The game tessellates the dome in mobile, colored hexagons that emulate both atoms and musical scale intervals in an expanding universe. Spatial activity in the game maps to spatial locale and instrument voices in the speakers, in essence creating a virtual orchestra with a string section, percussion section, etc. on the dome. Future work includes distribution of game play via mobile devices to permit attendees to participate in a performance.

abstract = {This work presents a general framework method for cre-ating spatialization systems focused on electroacoustic andacousmatic music performance and creation. Although weused the logistic equation as orbit generator, any dynami-cal system could be suitable. The main idea lies on generating vectors of Rn with entriesfrom data series of di{\_}x000B{\_}erent orbits from an speci{\_}x000C{\_}c dynami-cal system. Such vectors will be called system vectors. Ourproposal is to create ordered paths between those pointsor system vectors using the Splines Quark library by Felix,1which allow us to generate smooth curves joining the points.Finally, interpolating that result with a {\_}x000C{\_}xed sample value,we are able to obtain speci{\_}x000C{\_}c and independent multidimen-sional panning trajectories for each speaker array and forany number of sound sources.Our contribution is intended to be at the very root of the compositionalprocess giving to the creator a method for exploring new ways for spatialsound placement over time for a wide range of speakers ar-rangements. The advantage of using controlled chaotic dy-namical systems like the logistic equation, lies on the factthat the composer can freely and consciously choose be-tween stable or irregular behaviour for the orbits that willgenerate his/her panning trajectories. Besides, with the useof isometries, it is possible to generate di{\_}x000B{\_}erent related or-bits with one single evaluation of the system. The use ofthe spline method in SuperCollider allows the possibilityof joining and relating those values from orbits into a wellde{\_}x000C{\_}ned and coherent general system. Further research willinclude controlling synthesis parameters in the same waywe created panning trajectories.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the OWL stage effects pedal and aims to present the device within the context of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research. The OWL is a dedicated, programmable audio device designed to provide an alternative to the use of laptop computers for bespoke audio processing on stage for music performance. By creating a software framework that allows the user to program their own code for the hardware in C++, the OWL project makes it possible to use homemade audio processing on stage without the need for a laptop running a computer music environment such as Pure Data or Supercollider. Moving away from the general-purpose computer to a dedicated audio device means that some of the potential problems and technical complexity of performing with a laptop computer onstage can be avoided, allowing the user to focus more of their attention on the musical performance. Within the format of a traditional guitar 'stomp box', the OWL aims to integrate seamlessly into a guitarist's existing pedal board setup, and in this way presents as an example of a ubiquitous and tangible computing device -a programmable computer designed to fit into an existing mode of musical performance whilst being transparent in use.},

But how often is it actually used, what is it used to describe, and how does its usage here differ from its usage in other fields of study? This paper presents a linguistic analysis of the motion-related terminology used in all of the papers published in the NIME conference proceedings to date (2001-- 2013). The results show that 'gesture' is in fact used in 62 {\%} of all NIME papers, which is a significantly higher percentage than in other music conferences (ICMC and SMC), and much more frequently than it is used in the HCI and biomechanics communities. The results from a collocation analysis support the claim that 'gesture' is used broadly in the NIME community, and indicate that it ranges from the description of concrete human motion and system control to quite metaphorical applications.},

As composers explore this medium it has become evident that the nature of spatial sound perception is complex. Yet interfaces for spatial composition are often simplistic and the end results can be disappointing. This paper presents an interface that is designed to liberate the composer from thinking of spatialised sound as points in space. Instead, visual images are used to define sound in terms of shape, size and location. Images can be sequenced into video, thereby creating rich and complex temporal soundscapes. The interface offers both the ability to craft soundscapes and also compose their evolution in time. },

Notes are played by touch, but are sustained through continuous movement. Pitch bends can be achieved by passing through the space between the notes. Its current implementation runs only on Apple iPad tablet computers using a libPd to convert user interaction into audio. An iPad overlay offers physical feedback for the circles as well as the pitch bend area between the circles. A performable version of the application has been built, though several active developments allow alternative sonic interpretation of the gestures, enhanced visual response to user interaction, and the ability to control the instrument with multiple devices.},

The goal of BioSync is toprovide a hybrid interface, which uses audience biometric responses foraudience participation techniques. To provide an affordable and scalablesolution, BioSync collects the user's heart rate via mobile phone pulseoximetry and the EEG data via Bluetooth communication with the off-the-shelfMindWave Mobile hardware. Various interfaces have been designed and implementedin the development of audience participation techniques and systems. In thedesign and concept of BioSync, we first summarize recent interface research foraudience participation within the NIME-related context, followed by the outlineof the BioSync methodology and interface design. We then present a techniquefor dynamic tempo control based on the audience biometric responses and anearly prototype of a mobile dual-channel pulse oximetry and EEG bi-directionalinterface for iOS device (BioSync).

abstract = {We present a framework for imitation of percussion performances with parameter-based learning for accurate reproduction. We constructed a robotic setup involving pull-solenoids attached to drum sticks which communicate with a computer through an Arduino microcontroller. The imitation framework allows for parameter adaptation to different mechanical constructions by learning the capabilities of the overall system being used. For the rhythmic vocabulary, we have considered regular stroke, flam and drag styles. A learning and calibration system was developed to efficiently perform grace notes for the drag rudiment as well as the single stroke and the flam rudiment. A second pre-performance process is introduced to minimize the latency difference between individual drum sticks in our mechanical setup. We also developed an off-line onset detection method to reliably recognize onsets from the microphone input. Once these pre-performance steps are taken, our setup will then listen to a human drummer's performance pattern, analyze for onsets, loudness, and rudiment pattern, and then play back using the learned parameters for the particular system. We conducted three different evaluations of our constructed system.},

Such a technique is useful for robots consisting of many strings: the ability to self-tune allows for long-term installation without human intervention as well as on-the-fly tuning scheme changes. The presented method consists of comparing a detuned string's pitch at runtime to a pre-compiled table of string responses at varying tensions. The behavior of the current detuned string is interpolated from the two nearest pre-characterized neighbors, and the desired virtual fret positions are added to the interpolated model. This method allows for rapid tuning at runtime, requiring only a single string actuation to determine the pitch. After a detailed description of the self-tuning technique and implementation, the results will be evaluated on the new Swivel 2 robotic slide guitar. The paper concludes with a discussion of performance applications and ideas for subsequent work on self-tuning musical robotic systems.},

A user study is conducted with the device to establish an indication of the practicality of using headstock tracking to control effect parameters and to suggest natural and useful mapping strategies. Individual movements and gestures are evaluated in order to guide further development of the system.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel controller built to exploit thephysical behaviour of a simple dynamical system, namely aspinning wheel. The phenomenon of gyroscopic precessioncauses the instrument to slowly oscillate when it is spunquickly, providing the performer with proprioceptive feedback. Also, due to the mass of the wheel and tire and theresulting rotational inertia, it maintains a relatively constant angular velocity once it is set in motion. Various sensors were used to measure continuous and discrete quantitiessuch as the the angular frequency of the wheel, its spatialorientation, and the performer's finger pressure. In addition, optical and hall-effect sensors detect the passing of aspoke-mounted photodiode and two magnets. A base software layer was developed in Max/MSP and various patcheswere written with the goal of mapping the dynamic behaviorof the wheel to varied musical processes.},

An experiment was performed in order to investigate which kind of gestures listeners associate to synthesised sounds produced using physical models, corresponding to three categories of sound: sustained, iterative and impulsive. The results of the experiment show that listeners perform similar gestures when controlling sounds from the different categories. We used such gestures in order to create the mapping strategy between the Gloves and the physically based synthesis engine.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of artists who make use of automated music performances in their music and live concerts. Automated music performance is a form of music production using programmed musical notes. Some artists who introduce automated music performance operate parameters of the sound in their performance for production of their music. In this paper, we focus on the music production aspects and describe a method that realizes operation of the sound parameters via computer. Further, in this study, the probability distribution of the action (i.e., variation of parameters) is obtained within the music, using Bayesian filters. The probability distribution of each piece of music is transformed by passing through a Markov model. After the probability distribution is obtained, sound parameters can be automatically controlled. We have developed a system to reproduce the musical expressions of humans and confirmed the possibilities of our method.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of user interaction with two explorative music environments (sound system A and B) that were inspired from the Banda Linda music tradition in two different ways. The sound systems adapted to how a team of two players improvised and made a melody together in an interleaved fashion: Systems A and B used a fuzzy logic algorithm and pattern recognition to respond with modifications of a background rhythms. In an experiment with a pen tablet interface as the music instrument, users aged 10-13 were to tap tones and continue each other's melody. The sound systems rewarded users sonically, if they managed to add tones to their mutual melody in a rapid turn taking manner with rhythmical patterns. Videos of experiment sessions show that user teams contributed to a melody in ways that resemble conversation. Interaction data show that each sound system made player teams play in different ways, but players in general had a hard time adjusting to a non-Western music tradition. The paper concludes with a comparison and evaluation of the two sound systems. Finally it proposes a new approach to the design of collaborative and shared music environments that is based on ''listening applications''.},

abstract = {Audiences of live laptop music frequently express dismay at the opacity of performer activity and question how ``live" performances actually are. Yet motionless laptop performers endure as musical spectacles from clubs to concert halls, suggesting that for many this is a non-issue. Understanding these perceptions might help performers better achieve their intentions, inform interface design within the NIME field and help develop theories of liveness and performance. To this end, a study of listeners' perception of liveness and performer control in laptop performance was carried out, in which listeners examined several short audio-only excerpts of laptop performances and answered questions about their perception of the performance: what they thought was happening and its sense of liveness. Our results suggest that audiences are likely to associate liveness with perceived performer activity such as improvisation and the audibility of gestures, whereas perceptions of generative material, backing tracks, or other preconceived material do not appear to inhibit perceptions of liveness.},

The model presented heredistinguishes gestural primitives from units of measure ofgestures. The throughput model identifies symmetry betweenperformance gestures and musical gestures, and indicates a rolefor gestural primitives when a performer navigates regions ofstable oscillations in a musical instrument. The use of a highdimensional interface tool is proposed for instrument design, forfine-tuning the mapping between movement sensor data andsound synthesis control data.},

The sponge itself is described, but the main focus is on the evolution of the mapping strategies that are used. The author reviews the guidelines proposed by other researchers and explains how they were concretely applied with the sponge. He concludes that no single strategy constitutes a solution to the issue of mapping and that musical compositions are complex entities that require the use of a multitude of mapping strategies in parallel. It is hoped that the mappings described combined with new strategies will eventually lead to the emergence of a musical language that is idiomatic to the sponge.},

Finite Difference (FD) methods can be the basis for physics-based music instrument models that generate realistic audio output. However, such methods are compute-intensive; large simulations cannot run in real time on current CPUs. Many current systems now include powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which are a good fit for FD methods. We demonstrate that it is possible to use this method to create a usable real-time audio synthesizer. },

This control parameter space is mapped to a corpus of soundscreated by these parameters and recorded, and these sounds are analysed usingsoftware created for concatenative synthesis.

However, during the course of our research to develop a full-hand vibrotactile musical communication device for the hearing-impaired, we repeatedly found evidence suggesting sensitivity to higher frequencies. Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators. The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices for music and other applications.},

In most of them, the rules to control these expressive aspects are predefined and users have to adapt to them. Other works have studied conductors' gestures in relation to the performance of the orchestra. The goal of this study is to analyze, following the path initiated by this latter kind of works, how simple motion capture descriptors can explain the relationship between the loudness of a given performance and the way in which different subjects move when asked to impersonate the conductor of that performance. Twenty-five subjects were asked to impersonate the conductor of three classical music fragments while listening to them. The results of different linear regression models with motion capture descriptors as explanatory variables show that, by studying how descriptors correlate to loudness differently among subjects, different tendencies can be found and exploited to design models that better adjust to their expectations.},

Inspired by the Touch{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} project, this paper discusses how to implement this technique using the community standard hardware Arduino instead of custom designed electronics. The technique requires only passive components and can be used to enhance the touch sensitivity of many everyday objects and even biological materials and substances such as plants, which this paper will focus on as a case study through the project known as Cultivating Frequencies. This paper will discuss different techniques of filtering data captured by this system, different methods for creating gesture recognition unique to the object being used, and the implications of this technology as it pertains to the goal of ubiquitous sensing.

By interfacing a network of pressure sensitive, light-emitting tiles with a 7.1 channel speaker system and requisite audio software, many avenues for collaborative expression emerge, as do heretofore unexplored modes of multiplayer music and dance gaming. By giving users light and sound cues that both guide and respond to their movement, a rich environment is created that playfully integrates the auditory, the visual, and the kinesthetic into a unified interactive experience.},

To make computers more vocallyexpressive, however, we need a deeper understanding of how nonlinguistic socialsignals are patterned and perceived. In this paper, we focus on laughterexpressions: how a phrase of vocalized notes that we call ""laughter"" may bemodeled and performed to implicate nuanced meaning imbued in the acousticsignal. In designing our model, we emphasize (1) using high-level descriptorsas control parameters, (2) enabling real-time performable laughter, and (3)prioritizing expressiveness over realism. We present an interactive systemimplemented in ChucK that allows users to systematically play with the musicalingredients of laughter. A crowdsourced study on the perception of synthesizedlaughter showed that our model is capable of generating a range of laughtertypes, suggesting an exciting potential for expressive laughter synthesis."},

abstract = {Nowadays many music artists rely on visualisations and light shows to enhanceand augment their live performances. However, the visualisation and triggeringof lights is normally scripted in advance and synchronised with the concert,severely limiting the artist's freedom for improvisation, expression and ad-hocadaptation of their show. These scripts result in performances where thetechnology enforces the artist and their music to stay in synchronisation withthe pre-programmed environment. We argue that these limitations can be overcomebased on emerging non-invasive tracking technologies in combination with anadvanced gesture recognition engine.We present a solution that uses explicit gestures and implicit dance moves tocontrol the visual augmentation of a live music performance. We furtherillustrate how our framework overcomes existing limitations of gestureclassification systems by delivering a precise recognition solution based on asingle gesture sample in combination with expert knowledge. The presentedsolution enables a more dynamic and spontaneous performance and, when combinedwith indirect augmented reality, results in a more intense interaction betweenthe artist and their audience.},

The results show that hitting the drum alternately from both sides with motion going through the drum plate was less accurate than the traditional one sided hitting. A physical stick was more accurate than a virtual computer graphic stick. Visual feedback of the drum slightly increased accuracy compared to receiving only auditory feedback.

abstract = {Touch user interfaces such as touchpad or pen tablet are often used forcontinuous pitch control in synthesis devices. Usually, pitch is set at thecontact point on the interface, thus introducing possible pitch inaccuracies atthe note onset. This paper proposes a new algorithm, based on an adaptiveattraction mapping, for improving initial pitch accuracy with touch userinterfaces with continuous control. At each new contact on the interface, thealgorithm adjusts the mapping to produce the most likely targeted note of thescale in the vicinity of the contact point. Then, pitch remains continuouslyadjustable as long as the contact is maintained, allowing for vibrato,portamento and other subtle melodic control. The results of experimentscomparing the users' pitch accuracy with and without the help of the algorithmshow that such a correction enables to play sharply in tune at the contact withthe interface, regardless the musical background of the player. Therefore, thedynamic mapping algorithm allows for a clean and accurate attack when playing touch user interfaces for controlling continuous pitch instruments like voicesynthesizers.},

People usually learn beatboxing in the traditional way of imitatingaudio sample without steps and instructions. Spectrogram contains a lot ofinformation about audio, but it is too complicated to be understood inreal-time. Reinforcement learning is a psychological method, which makes use ofreward and/or punishment as stimulus to train the decision-making process ofhuman. We propose a novel music learning approach based on the reinforcementlearning method, which makes use of compact and easy-to-read spectruminformation as visual clue to assist human beatboxing learning on smartphone.Experimental result shows that the visual information is easy to understand inreal-time, which improves the effectiveness of beatboxing self-learning.},

abstract = {In this paper, the authors introduce an interactive device, ``POWDER BOX''for use by novices in musical sessions. ``POWDER BOX'' is equipped withsensor-based replaceable interfaces, which enable participants to discover andselect their favorite playing styles of musical instruments during a musicalsession. In addition, it has a wireless communication function thatsynchronizes musical scale and BPM between multiple devices. To date, various kinds of ``inventive'' electronic musical instruments havebeen created in the field of Computer Music field. The authors are interestedin formations of musical sessions, aiming for a balance between simpleinteraction and musical expression. This study focuses on the development ofperformance playing styles.Musicians occasionally change their playing styles (e.g., guitar pluckingstyle) during a musical session. Generally, it is difficult for nonmusicians toachieve this kind of smooth changing depends on levels of their skillacquisition. However, it is essentially important for enjoying musical sessionswhether people could acquire these skills. Here, the authors attempted to develop the device that supports nonmusicians toconquer this point using replaceable interfaces. The authors expected thatchanging interfaces would bring similar effect as changing playing style by theskillful player. This research aims to establish an environment in whichnonmusicians and musicians share their individual musical ideas easily. Here,the interaction design and configuration of the ``POWDER BOX'' is presented.},

abstract = {This paper explores the concept of end-user programming languages in music composition, and introduces the Manhattan system, which integrates formulas with a grid-based style of music sequencer. Following the paradigm of spreadsheets, an established model of end-user programming, Manhattan is designed to bridge the gap between traditional music editing methods (such as MIDI sequencing and typesetting) and generative and algorithmic music -seeking both to reduce the learning threshold of programming and support flexible integration of static and dynamic musical elements in a single work. Interaction draws on rudimentary knowledge of mathematics and spreadsheets to augment the sequencer notation with programming concepts such as expressions, built-in functions, variables, pointers and arrays, iteration (for loops), branching (goto), and conditional statements (if-then-else). In contrast to other programming tools, formulas emphasise the visibility of musical data (e.g. notes), rather than code, but also allow composers to interact with notated music from a more abstract perspective of musical processes. To illustrate the function and use cases of the system, several examples of traditional and generative music are provided, the latter drawing on minimalism (process-based music) as an accessible introduction to algorithmic composition. Throughout, the system and approach are evaluated using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework, together with early feedback for use by artists.},

Thepedals and wheel provide a tactile interface for controlling thecar dynamics and musical expression, while the displayportrays a first person view of the road and dashboard from thedriver's seat. This game-like interface allows non-experts tocreate expressive renderings of existing music without havingto master an instrument, and allows expert musicians toexperiment with expressive choice without having to firstmaster the notes of the piece.

In some courses they are typically gettingin touch online with each others for doing some particular group workassignments, but most of the time they must do their own learning tasks alone.In other courses simply the individual assignments and quizzes are provided, sothe learners are alone all the time from the beginning until the end of thecourse.In order to keep the learners' motivation, it helps to feel other learnersdoing the same learning activities and belonging to the same course.Communicating formally or informally with other learners via Social NetworkingServices or something is one way for learners to get such a feeling, though ina way it might sometimes disturb their learning. Sonification of the access logof the e-learning system could be another indirect way to provide such afeeling.},

The audiences' continuous emotional response data are also represented as a time series, and the series are compared.

In this paper, we focus on laughterexpressions: how a phrase of vocalized notes that we call ""laughter"" may bemodeled and performed to implicate nuanced meaning imbued in the acousticsignal. In designing our model, we emphasize (1) using high-level descriptorsas control parameters, (2) enabling real-time performable laughter, and (3)prioritizing expressiveness over realism. We present an interactive systemimplemented in ChucK that allows users to systematically play with the musicalingredients of laughter. A crowdsourced study on the perception of synthesizedlaughter showed that our model is capable of generating a range of laughtertypes, suggesting an exciting potential for expressive laughter synthesis."},

abstract = {"Since Euler's development of the Tonnetz in 1739, musicians, composers andinstrument designers have been fascinated with the concept of musicalisomorphism, the idea that by arranging tones by their harmonic relationshipsrather than by their physical properties, the common shapes of musicalconstructs will appear, facilitating learning and new ways of exploringharmonic spaces. The construction of isomorphic instruments, beyond limitedsquare isomorphisms present in many stringed instruments, has been a challengein the past for two reasons: The first problem, that of re-arranging noteactuators from their sounding elements, has been solved by digital instrumentdesign. The second, more conceptual problem, is that only a single isomorphismcan be designed for any one instrument, requiring the instrument designer (aswell as composer and performer) to ""lock in"" to a single isomorphism, or tohave a different instrument for each isomorphism in order to experiment. Musix(an iOS application) and Rainboard (a physical device) are two new musicalinstruments built to overcome this and other limitations of existing isomorphicinstruments. Musix was developed to allow experimentation with a wide varietyof different isomorphic layouts, to assess the advantages and disadvantages ofeach. The Rainboard consists of a hexagonal array of arcade buttons embeddedwith RGB-LEDs, which are used to indicate characteristics of the isomorphismcurrently in use on the Rainboard. The creation of these two instruments /experimentation platforms allows for isomorphic layouts to be explored in waysthat are not possible with existing instruments."},

The survey focused on the question of embodiment and its different modalities in the fields of acoustic and digital instruments. The questions of control, instrumental entropy, limitations and creativity were addressed in relation to people's activities of playing, creating or modifying their instruments. The approach used in the survey was phenomenological, i.e. we were concerned with the experience of playing, composing for and designing digital or acoustic instruments. At the time of analysis, we had 209 replies from musicians, composers, engineers, designers, artists and others interested in this topic. The survey was mainly aimed at instrumentalists and people who create their own instruments or compositions in flexible audio programming environments such as SuperCollider, Pure Data, ChucK, Max/MSP, CSound, etc. },

@inproceedings{Mullen2011,
abstract = {The use of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) in the experimental arts is not a novel concept. Since 1965, EEG has been used in a large number of, sometimes highly sophisticated, systems for musical and artistic expression. However, since the advent of the synthesizer, most such systems have utilized digital and/or synthesized media in sonifying the EEG signals. There have been relatively few attempts to create interfaces for musical expression that allow one to mechanically manipulate acoustic instruments by modulating one's mental state. Secondly, few such systems afford a distributed performance medium, with data transfer and audience participation occurring over the Internet. The use of acoustic instruments and Internet-enabled communication expands the realm of possibilities for musical expression in Brain-Computer Music Interfaces (BCMI), while also introducing additional challenges. In this paper we report and examine a first demonstration (Music for Online Performer) of a novel system for Internet-enabled manipulation of robotic acoustic instruments, with feedback, using a non-invasive EEG-based BCI and low-cost, commercially available robotics hardware. },

With the advent of Internet communication, geographical displacement amongst the participants of a computer mediated music performance achieved world wide extension. However, when established over long distance networks, this form of musical communication has a fundamental problem: network latency (or net-delay) is an impediment for real-time collaboration. From a recent study, carried out by the , , authors, a relation between network latency tolerance and Music Tempo was established. This result emerged from an experiment, in which simulated network latency conditions were applied to the performance of different musicians playing jazz standard tunes. The Public Sound Objects (PSOs) project is web-based shared musical space, which has been an experimental framework to implement and test different approaches for on-line music communication. This paper describe features implemented in the latest version of the PSOs system, including the notion of a network-music instrument incorporating latency as a software function, by dynamically adapting its tempo to the communication delay measured in real-time.},

However, control over these high-dimensional interfaces is constrained by the physical limitations of performers. In this paper we propose the exploitation of vocal gesture as an extension or alternative to traditional physical controllers. The approach uses dynamic aspects of vocal sound to control variations in the timbre of the synthesized sound. The mapping from vocal to synthesis parameters is automatically adapted to information extracted from vocal examples as well as to the relationship between parameters and timbre within the synthesizer. The mapping strategy aims to maximize the breadth of the explorable perceptual sonic space over a set of the synthesizer's real-valued parameters, indirectly driven by the voice-controlled interface.},

abstract = {Wireless technology is growing increasingly prevalent in the development of new interfaces for live music performance. However, with a number of different wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band, there is a high risk of interference and congestion, which has the potential to severely disrupt live performances. With its high transmission power, channel bandwidth and throughput, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) presents an opportunity for highly robust wireless communications. This paper presents our preliminary work optimising the components of a Wi-Fi system for live performance scenarios. We summarise the manufacture and testing of a prototype directional antenna that is designed to maximise sensitivity to a performer's signal while suppressing interference from elsewhere. We also propose a set of recommended Wi-Fi configurations to reduce latency and increase throughput. Practical investigations utilising these arrangements demonstrate a single x-OSC device achieving a latency of {\textless}3 ms and a distributed network of 15 devices achieving a net throughput of {\~{}}4800 packets per second ({\~{}}320 per device); where each packet is a 104-byte OSC message containing 16 analogue input channels acquired by the device.},

The Novint Falcon force feedback interfaceis used to scan through soundfiles as a subject moves their hand horizontallyfrom left to right, and to relay information about volume, frequency content,noisiness, or potentially any analysable parameter back to the subject throughforces acting on their hand. General practicalities of mapping sonic elements to physical forces areconsidered, such as the problem of representing detailed data through vaguephysical sensation, approaches to applying forces to the hand that do notinterfering with the smooth operation of the device, and the relative merits ofdiscreet and continuous mappings. Three approaches to generating the forcevector are discussed: 1) the use of simulated detents to identify areas of anaudio parameter over a certain threshold, 2) applying friction proportional tothe level of the audio parameter along the axis of movement, and 3) creatingforces perpendicular to the subject's hand movements.Presentation of audio information in this manner could be beneficial for`pre-feeling' as a method for selecting material to play during a liveperformance, assisting visually impaired audio engineers, and as a generalaugmentation of standard audio editing environments.},

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a design of alearning environment for a novice learner to acquire an accurate fingerposition skill. For achieving the aim, we developed a learning environmentwhich can diagnose learner's finger position and give the learner advice byusing magnetic position sensors. The system shows three windows; a fingerposition window for visualization of finger position, a score window fordiagnosing finger position along the score and command prompt window forshowing states of system and advices. Finally, we evaluated the system by anexperiment. The experimental group improved accuracy values about fingerpositions and also improved accuracy of pitches of sounds compared withcontrol group. These results shows significant differences.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a pitch space based musical interface approach. A pitch space arranges tones in a way that meaningful tone combinations can be easily generated. Using a touch sensitive surface or a 3D-Joystick a player can move through the pitch space and create the desired sound by selecting tones. The more optimal the tones are geometrically arranged, the less control parameters are required to move through the space and to select the desired pitches. For this the quality of pitch space based musical interfaces depends on two factors: 1. the way how the tones are organized within the pitch space and 2. the way how the parameters of a given controller are used to move through the space and to select pitches. This paper presents a musical interface based on a tonal pitch space derived from a four dimensional model found by the music psychologists [11], [2]. The proposed pitch space particularly eases the creation of tonal harmonic music. Simultaneously it outlines music psychological and theoretical principles of music. },

The various controllers are designed to be very easy and intuitive so anyone can pick one up and quickly be able to play it.

A set of movable electrodes (+, -, ground) made from soldered stacks of coins create a dynamic voltage potential field in the carbon layer, and an- other set of movable electrodes tap voltages from this field. These voltages are used to control complex sound engines in an analogue modular synthesizer. Both the voltage field and the tap electrodes can be moved freely. The design was inspired by previous research in complex mappings for advanced digital instruments, and provides a similarly dynamic playing environment for analogue synthesis. The interface is cheap to build, and provides flexible control over a large set of parameters. It is musically satisfying to play, and allows for a wide range of playing techniques, from wild exploration to subtle expressions. I also present an inven- tory of the available playing techniques, motivated by the interface design, musically, conceptually and theatrically. The performance aspects of the interface are also discussed. The interface has been used in a number of performances in Sweden and Japan in 2011, and is also used by other musicians.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a musical performance feedback system based on real-time audio-score alignment for musical instrument education of beginner musicians. In the proposed system, we do not make use of symbolic data such as MIDI, but acquire a real-time audio input from on-board microphone of smartphone. Then, the system finds onset and pitch of the note from the signal, to align this information with the ground truth musical score. Real-time alignment allows the system to evaluate whether the user played the correct note or not, regardless of its timing, which enables user to play at their own speed, as playing same tempo with original musical score is problematic for beginners. As an output of evaluation, the system notifies the user about which part they are currently performing, and which note were played incorrectly.},

In this paper, we present anovel multi-touch interface method aimed at professional keyboard players. Themethod, which is inspired by computer trackpads, allows controlling up to tencontinuous parameters of a keyboard with one hand, without requiring the userto look at the touch area - a significant improvement over traditional keyboardinput controls. We discuss optimizations needed to make our interface reliable,and show in an evaluation with four keyboarders of different skill level thatthis method is both intuitive and powerful, and allows users to more quicklyalter the sound of their keyboard than they could with current input solutions.},

This paper presents SynthAssist, a system for interactively searching the synthesis space of an audio synthesizer. In this work, we present how to use the system for querying a database of audio synthesizer patches (i.e. settings/parameters) by vocal imitation and user feed- back. To account for the limitations of the human voice, it uses both absolute and relative time series representations of features and relevance feedback on both the feature weights and time series to refine the query. The method presented in this paper can be used to search through large databases of previously existing ``factory presets" or program a synthesizer using the data-driven approach to automatic synthesizer programming.},

abstract = {Several new technologies to capture motion, gesture and forces for musical instrument players' analyses have been developed in the last years. In research and for augmented instruments one parameter is underrepresented so far. It is finger position and pressure measurement, applied by the musician while playing the musical instrument. In this paper we show a flexible linear-potentiometer and forcesensitive-resistor (FSR) based solution for position, pressure and force sensing between the contact point of the fingers and the musical instrument. A flexible matrix printed circuit board (PCB) is fixed on a piano key. We further introduce linear potentiometer based left hand finger position sensing for string instruments, integrated into a violin and a guitar finger board. Several calibration and measurement scenarios are shown. The violin sensor was evaluated with 13 music students regarding playability and robustness of the system. Main focus was a the integration of the sensors into these two traditional musical instruments as unobtrusively as possible to keep natural haptic playing sensation. The musicians playing the violin in different performance situations stated good playability and no differences in the haptic sensation while playing. The piano sensor is rated, due to interviews after testing it in a conventional keyboard quite unobtrusive, too, but still evokes a different haptic sensation.},

We ground our concept as an extension of work by David Tudor, Nicolas Collins and Bowers and Archer [NIME 2005] and draw on a variety of critical perspectives in the social sciences and philosophy to explore such assemblages as an alternative to more familiar ideas of instruments and interfaces. We lay out a conceptual framework for the exploration of hybrid resonant assemblages and describe how we have approached implementing them. Our performance experience is presented and implications for work are discussed. In the light of our work, we urge a reconsideration of the implicit norms of performance which underlie much research in NIME. In particular, drawing on the philosophical work of Jean-Luc Nancy, we commend a wider notion of touch that also recognises the performative value of withholding contact.},

Applying the techniques of AFCs to different contexts, such as musical performance, sound installations, and product design, presents a unique insight into the research of embodied sonic interfaces and environments. This paper presents techniques that use digital acoustic feedback control algorithms to augment the sonic properties of environments and discusses approaches to the design of sonically playful experiences that apply such techniques. Three experimental prototypes are described to illustrate how the techniques can be applied to versatile environments and continuous coupling of users' audible actions with sonically augmented environments. The knowledge obtained from these prototypes has led to Acoustic Feedback Ecology System (AFES) design patterns. The paper concludes with some future research directions based on the prototypes and proposes several other potentially useful applications ranging from musical performance to everyday contexts.},

This is achieved using a real-time Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the model coupled to an interface that aims to make efficient use of all the subtle nuanced gestures of the instrumentalist. It is based on a complex physical model of the vibrating plate - the source of sound in the majority of percussion instruments. A Xilinx Virtex II pro FPGA core handles the sound synthesis computations with an 8 billion operations per second performance and has been designed in such a way to allow a high level of control and flexibility. Strategies are also presented to that allow the parametric space of the model to be mapped to the playing gestures of the percussionist. },

The technique requires only passive components and can be used to enhance the touch sensitivity of many everyday objects and even biological materials and substances such as plants, which this paper will focus on as a case study through the project known as Cultivating Frequencies. This paper will discuss different techniques of filtering data captured by this system, different methods for creating gesture recognition unique to the object being used, and the implications of this technology as it pertains to the goal of ubiquitous sensing.

abstract = {Echo State Networks (ESNs), a form of recurrent neural network developed in the field of Reservoir Computing, show significant potential for use as a tool in the design of mappings for digital musical instruments. They have, however, seldom been used in this area, so this paper explores their possible uses. This project contributes a new open source library, which was developed to allow ESNs to run in the Pure Data dataflow environment. Several use cases were explored, focusing on addressing current issues in mapping research. ESNs were found to work successfully in scenarios of pattern classification, multiparametric control, explorative mapping and the design of nonlinearities and uncontrol. $\backslash$emph{\{}Un-trained{\}} behaviours are proposed, as augmentations to the conventional reservoir system that allow the player to introduce potentially interesting non-linearities and uncontrol into the reservoir. Interactive evolution style controls are proposed as strategies to help design these behaviours, which are otherwise dependent on arbitrary parameters. A study on sound classification shows that ESNs can reliably differentiate between two drum sounds, and also generalise to other similar input. Following evaluation of the use cases, heuristics are proposed to aid the use of ESNs in computer music scenarios.},

The study is driven by an audiovisual emotion library project that is named AVIEM, which provides an interactive interface for experimentation and evaluation of the perception and creation processes of audiovisuals. AVIEM primarily consists of separate audio and visual libraries and grows with user contribution as users explore different combinations between them. The library provides a wide range of experimentation possibilities by allowing users to create audiovisual relations and logging their emotional responses through its interface. Besides being a resourceful tool of experimentation, AVIEM aims to become a source of inspiration, where digitally created abstract virtual environments and soundscapes can elicit target emotions at a preconscious level, by building genuine audiovisual relations that would engage the viewer on a strong emotional stage. Lastly, various schemes are proposed to visualize information extracted through AVIEM, to improve the navigation and designate the trends and dependencies among audiovisual relations.},

In addition, it has a wireless communication function thatsynchronizes musical scale and BPM between multiple devices. To date, various kinds of ``inventive'' electronic musical instruments havebeen created in the field of Computer Music field. The authors are interestedin formations of musical sessions, aiming for a balance between simpleinteraction and musical expression. This study focuses on the development ofperformance playing styles.Musicians occasionally change their playing styles (e.g., guitar pluckingstyle) during a musical session. Generally, it is difficult for nonmusicians toachieve this kind of smooth changing depends on levels of their skillacquisition. However, it is essentially important for enjoying musical sessionswhether people could acquire these skills. Here, the authors attempted to develop the device that supports nonmusicians toconquer this point using replaceable interfaces. The authors expected thatchanging interfaces would bring similar effect as changing playing style by theskillful player. This research aims to establish an environment in whichnonmusicians and musicians share their individual musical ideas easily.

The manipulation of these objects allows spectators to contribute to the visual and sonic outcome of the performance through their mobile devices, while keeping their freedom to focus on the stage.

The system not only aims to reflect emotional states but to direct and induce emotional states through the real-time generation of the score, highlighting the potential of direct neural-emotional manipulation in live performance. The EEG of the vocalist and one audience member is measured throughout the performance and the system generates a real-time score based on mapping the emotional features within the EEG. We measure the two emotional descriptors, valence and arousal, within EEG and map the two-dimensional correlate of averaged windows to musical phrases. These pre-composed phrases contain associated emotional content based on the KTH Performance Rules System (Director Musices). The piece is in three movements, the first two are led by the emotions of each subject respectively, whilst the third movement interpolates the combined response of the performer and audience member. The system not only aims to reflect the individuals' emotional states but also attempts to induce a shared emotional experience by drawing the two responses together. This work highlights the potential available in affecting neural-emotional manipulation within live performance and demonstrates a new approach to real-time, affectively-driven composition.},

abstract = {This paper presents the findings of two exploratory studies. In these studies participants performed a series of image-sound association tasks. The aim of the studies was to investigate the perceived similarity and the efficacy of two multidimensional mappings each consisting of three audio-visual associations. The purpose of the mappings is to enable visual control of corpus-based concatenative synthesis. More specifically the stimuli in the first study was designed to test the perceived similarity of six audio-visual associations, between the two mappings using three corpora resulting in 18 audio-visual stimuli. The corpora differ in terms of two sound characteristics: harmonic contain and continuity. Data analysis revealed no significant differences in the participant's responses between the three corpora, or between the two mappings. However highly significant differences were revealed between the individual audio-visual association pairs. The second study investigates the affects of the mapping and the corpus in the ability of the participants to detect which image out of three similar images was used to generate six audio stimuli. The data analysis revealed significant differences in the ability of the participants' to detect the correct image depending on which corpus was used. Less significant was the effect of the mapping in the success rate of the participant responses.},

abstract = {Recent technological improvements in audio reproduction systems increased the possibilities to spatialize sources in a listening environment. The spatialization of reproduced audio is however highly dependent on the recording technique, the rendering method, and the loudspeaker configuration. While object-based audio production has proven to reduce the dependency on loudspeaker configurations, authoring tools are still considered to be difficult to interact with in current production environments. In this paper, we investigate the issues of spatialization techniques for object-based audio production and introduce the Spatial Audio Design Spaces (SpADS) framework, that provides insights into the spatial manipulation of object-based audio. Based on interviews with professional sound engineers, this morphological analysis clarifies the relationships between recording and rendering techniques that define audio-objects for 3D speaker configurations, allowing the analysis and the design of advanced object-based controllers as well.},

As mobile phones' MIDI players do not usually have a dedicated callback API, a real-time MIDI analysis software for Symbian OS was implemented. Future developments including real-time group performance as a way to control game content are also considered. },

However, at present, using audio analysis algorithms in live performance requires either some detailed knowledge about the algorithms themselves, or programming - or both. Those wishing to use audio analysis in live performances may not have either of these as their strengths. Rather, they may instead wish to focus upon systems that respond to audio analysis data, such as visual projections or sound generators. In response, this paper introduces the Sound Analyser - an audio plug-in allowing users to a) select a custom set of audio analyses to be performed in real-time and b) send that information via OSC so that it can easily be used by other systems to develop responsive applications for live performances and installations. A description of the system architecture and audio analysis algorithms implemented in the plug-in is presented before moving on to two case studies where the plug-in has been used in the field with artists.},

McBlare is MIDI controlled, allowing for simple interfacing to a keyboard, computer, or hardware sequencer. The control mechanism exceeds the measured speed of expert human performers. On the other hand, human performers surpass McBlare in their ability to compensate for limitations and imperfections in reeds, and we discuss future enhancements to address these problems. McBlare has been used to perform traditional bagpipe music as well as experimental computer generated music. },

Computer music ensembles such as laptop orchestras are becoming increasingly common and provide laboratories for the exploration of these possibilities. However, much of the literature regarding the creation of DMIs has been focused on individual expressivity, and their potential for collaborative performance has been under-utilized. This paper makes the case for the benefits of an approach to digital musical instrument design that begins with their collaborative potential, examines several frameworks and sets of principles for the creation of digital musical instruments, and proposes a dimension space representation of collaborative approaches which can be used to evaluate and guide future DMI creation. Several examples of DMIs and compositions are then evaluated and discussed in the context of this dimension space.},

abstract = {Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs) .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging. One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.},

Despite the richness of EEG, fMRI and other data which can be read from the human brain, there has up to now been only limited success in translating the complex encephalographic data into satisfactory musical results. We are currently pursuing research which we believe will lead to the possibility of direct brain-computer interfaces for rich and expressive musical control.

abstract = {This paper outlines a theoretical framework for creative technology based on two contrasting processes: divergent exploration and convergent optimisation. We claim that these two cases require different gesture-to-parameter mapping properties. Results are presented from a user experiment that motivates this theory. The experiment was conducted using a publicly available iPad app: ``Sonic Zoom''. Participants were encouraged to conduct an open ended exploration of synthesis timbre using a combination of two different interfaces. The first was a standard interface with ten sliders, hypothesised to be suited to the ``convergent'' stage of creation. The second was a mapping of the entire 10-D combinatorial space to a 2-D surface using a space filling curve. This novel interface was intended to support the ``divergent'' aspect of creativity. The paths of around 250 users through both 2-D and 10-D space were logged and analysed. Both the interaction data and questionnaire results show that the different interfaces tended to be used for different aspects of sound creation, and a combination of these two navigation styles was deemed to be more useful than either individually. The study indicates that the predictable, separate parameters found in most music technology are more appropriate for convergent tasks.},

abstract = {For a number of years, musicians in different locations have been able toperform with one another over a network as though present on the same stage.However, rather than attempt to re-create an environment for Network MusicPerformance (NMP) that mimics co-present performance as closely as possible, wepropose focusing on providing musicians with additional controls that can helpincrease the level of interaction between them. To this end, we have developeda reactive environment for distributed performance that provides participantsdynamic, real-time control over several aspects of their performance, enablingthem to change volume levels and experience exaggerated stereo panning. Inaddition, our reactive environment reinforces a feeling of a ``shared space''between musicians. It differs most notably from standard ventures into thedesign of novel musical interfaces and installations in its reliance onuser-centric methodologies borrowed from the field of Human-ComputerInteraction (HCI). Not only does this research enable us to closely examine thecommunicative aspects of performance, it also allows us to explore newinterpretations of the network as a performance space. This paper describes themotivation and background behind our project, the work that has been undertakentowards its realization and the future steps that have yet to be explored.},

abstract = {During several decades, the research at Waseda University has been focused on developing anthropomorphic robots capable performing musical instruments. As a result of our research efforts, the Waseda Flutist Robot WF-4RIV and the Waseda Saxophonist Robot WAS-1 have been designed to reproduce the human player performance. As a long-term goal, we are proposing to enable the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with human players. In general the communication of humans within a band is a special case of conventional human social behavior. Rhythm, harmony and timbre of the music played represent the emotional states of the musicians. So the development of an artificial entity that participates in such an interaction may contribute to the better understanding of some of the mechanisms that enable the communication of humans in musical terms. Therefore, we are not considering a musical performance robot (MPR) just as a mere sophisticated MIDI instrument. Instead, its human-like design and the integration of perceptual capabilities may enable to act on its own autonomous initiative based on models which consider its own physical constrains. In this paper, we present an overview of our research approaches towards enabling the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with musicians. },

abstract = {In this paper we present some custom designed filters for real-time motion capture applications. Our target application is motion controllers, i.e. systems that interpret hand motion for musical interaction. In earlier research we found effective methods to design nearly optimal filters for realtime applications. However, to be able to design suitable filters for our target application, it is necessary to establish the typical frequency content of the motion capture data we want to filter. This will again allow us to determine a reasonable cutoff frequency for the filters. We have therefore conducted an experiment in which we recorded the hand motion of 20 subjects. The frequency spectra of these data together with a method similar to the residual analysis method were then used to determine reasonable cutoff frequencies. Based on this experiment, we propose three cutoff frequencies for different scenarios and filtering needs: 5, 10 and 15 Hz, which correspond to heavy, medium and light filtering, respectively. Finally, we propose a range of real-time filters applicable to motion controllers. In particular, low-pass filters and low-pass differentiators of degrees one and two, which in our experience are the most useful filters for our target application.},

In addition, participants can change master/slave role between performers immediately. Our primary motivation is to provide musicians and nonmusicians with opportunities to experience a collaborative electronic music performance. Here, the hardware and interaction design of the device is presented. To date, numerous collaborative musical instruments have been developed in electronic music field [1][2][3]. The authors are interested in formations of musical sessions using stand-alone devices and leader/follower relationship in musical sessions. The authors specify three important requirements of instrument design for musical session. They are as follows: (1) Simple Interface: Interface that enables performers to control three sound elements (pitch, timbre, and amplitude) with simple interaction. (2) Portable Stand-alone System: System that runs standalone (with sound generators, speakers, and butteries). Because musical sessions can be improvised at any place and time, the authors consider that portability is essential in designing musical instruments for sessions. (3) Wireless Synchronization: System that supports ensembles by automatically synchronizing tempo (BPM) and tonality between multiple devices by air because of portability. In addition, performers can switch master/slave roles smoothly such as leader/follower relationship during a musical session. The authors gave ten live performances using this device at domestic and international events. In these events, the authors confirmed that our proposed wireless synchronization system worked stable. It is suggested that our system demonstrate the practicality of wireless synchronization. In future, the authors will evaluate the device in terms of its stability in multi-performer musical sessions.},

As a further development of a previous exploration [16] we outline the setup and interaction methods of `Skintimacy', an instrument that appropriates the skin for low voltage power transmission in multi-player interaction. Observations deriving from proof-of- concept exploration and performances using the instrument are brought into the reflection and discussion concerning the capabilities and limitations of skin as an input surface.},

Spectrogram contains a lot ofinformation about audio, but it is too complicated to be understood inreal-time. Reinforcement learning is a psychological method, which makes use ofreward and/or punishment as stimulus to train the decision-making process ofhuman. We propose a novel music learning approach based on the reinforcementlearning method, which makes use of compact and easy-to-read spectruminformation as visual clue to assist human beatboxing learning on smartphone.Experimental result shows that the visual information is easy to understand inreal-time, which improves the effectiveness of beatboxing self-learning.},

Controlling the placement of sound sources is usually done in idiosyncratic ways and has not yet been fully explored and formalized.

The Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework and Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory are combined to demonstrate how non-realtime, notation-mediated interaction can support focused, immersive, energetic, and intrinsically-rewarding musical experiences, and to what extent they are supported in the interfaces of music production software.

abstract = {Moving out of doors with digital tools and electronic music and creating musically rich experiences is made possible by the increased availability of ever smaller and more powerful mobile computers. Composing music for and in a landscape instead of for a closed architectural space offers new perspectives but also raises questions about interaction and composition of electronic music. The work we present here was commissioned by a festival and ran on a daily basis over a period of three months. A GPS-enabled embedded Linux system is assembled to serve as a location-aware sound platform. Several challenges have to be overcome both technically and artistically to achieve a seamless experience and provide a simple device to be handed to the public. By building this interactive experience, which relies as much on the user's willingness to explore the invisible sonic landscape as on the ability to deploy the technology, a number of new avenues for exploring electronic music and interactivity in location-based media open up. New ways of composing music for and in a landscape and for creating audience interaction are explored. },

This approach utilizes Max/MSP to allow any player an easy and low cost way to apply and experiment innovative music interfaces for live performance, without losing the professionalism required on stage. In that approach, every 1-3 players is plugged to a unit consisting of a standard sound-card and laptop. This unit is controlled by an interface that schedules and manages all the digital sounds made by each player (VST effects, VST instruments and 'home-made' interactive interfaces). All the player's units are then remotely controlled by a conduc- tor patch which is in charge of the synchronization of all the players and background samples in real time, as well as pro- viding sensitive metronome and scheduling visual enhance- ment. Moreover, and not less important, we can take the advantage of using virtual instruments and virtual effects in Max environment to manage the mix, and routing the au- dio. This providing monitors and metronome to the players ears, and virtual mixing via Max/MSP patch. This privi- lege almost eliminates the dependency in the venue's equipment, and in that way, the sound quality and music ideas can be taken out directly from the studio to the stage.},

abstract = {We introduce and describe the initial evaluation of a new low-cost augmented violin prototype, with research focused on the user experience when playing such hybrid physical-digital instruments, and the exploration of novel interactive performance techniques. Another goal of this work is wider platform accessibility for players, via a simple `do-it-yourself' approach described by the design herein. While the hardware and software elements are open source, the build process can nonetheless require non-insignificant investments of time and money, as well as basic electronics construction skills. These have been kept to a minimum wherever possible. Our initial prototype is based upon an inexpensive electric violin that is widely available online for approximately 200 USD. This serves as the starting point for construction, to which the design adds local Digital Signal Processing (DSP), gestural sensing, and sound output. Real-time DSP algorithms are running on a mobile device, which also incorporates orientation/gesture sensors for parameter mapping, with the resulting sound amplified and rendered via small loudspeakers mounted on the instrument. The platform combines all necessary elements for digitally-mediated interactive performance; the need for a traditional computer only arises when developing new DSP algorithms for the platform. An initial exploratory evaluation with users is presented, in which performers explore different possibilities with the proposed platform (various DSP implementations, mapping schemes, physical setups, etc.) in order to better establish the needs of the performing artist. Based on these results, future work is outlined leading towards the development of a complete quartet of instruments.},

abstract = {We present the digital musical instrument TouchNoise that is based on multitouch interaction with a particle system. It implements a novel interface concept for modulating noise spectra. Each particle represents a sine oscillator that moves through the two-dimensional frequency and stereo panning domain via Brownian motion. Its behavior can be affected by multitouch gestures allowing the shaping of the resulting sound in many different ways. Particles can be dragged, attracted, repelled, accentuated, and their autonomous behavior can be manipulated. In this paper we introduce the concepts behind this instrument, describe its implementation and discuss the sonic design space emerging from it.},

At run-time, conga searches for the best profileto match a user's gestures in real-time, and uses a beat prediction algorithm to provide results at the sub-beat level, in additionto output values such as tempo, gesture size, and the gesture'sgeometric center. Unlike some previous approaches, conga doesnot need to be trained with sample data before use. Our preliminary user tests show that conga has a beat recognition rate ofover 90{\%}. conga is deployed as the gesture recognition systemfor Maestro!, an interactive conducting exhibit that opened in theBetty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee, USA in March2006.},

@article{OSullivan2012,
abstract = {Development of new musical interfaces often requires experimentation with the mapping of available controller inputs to output parameters. Useful mappings for a particular application may be complex in nature, with one or more inputs being linked to one or more outputs. Existing development environments are commonly used to program such mappings, while code libraries provide powerful data-stream manipulation. However, room exists for a standalone application with a simpler graphical user interface for dynamically patching between inputs and outputs. This paper presents an early prototype version of a software tool that allows the user to route control signals in real time, using various messaging formats. It is cross-platform and runs as a standalone application in desktop and Android OS versions. The latter allows the users of mobile devices to experiment with mapping signals to and from physical computing components using the inbuilt multi-touch screen. Potential uses therefore include real-time mapping during performance in a more expressive manner than facilitated by existing tools.},

abstract = {This article describes the motivations and reflections that led to thedevelopment of a gestural sensor instrument called the Quarterstaff. In aniterative design and fabrication process, several versions of this interfacewere build, tested and evaluated in performances. A detailed explanation of thedesign choices concerning the shape but also the sensing capabilities of theinstrument illustrates the emphasis on establishing an `enactive'instrumental relationship. A musical practice for this type of instrument isshown by discussing the methods used in the exploration of the gesturalpotential of the interface and the strategies deployed for the development ofmappings and compositions. Finally, to gain more information about how thisinstrument compares with similar designs, two dimension-space analyses are madethat show a clear positioning in relation to instruments that precede theQuarterstaff.},

The increased presence of multichannel devices, along with the high sampling frequency, makesthe sound card desirable as a generic interface for acquisition of analog signals in prototyping of sensor-based musicinterfaces. However, due to the need for coupling capacitorsat a sound card's inputs and outputs, the use as a genericsignal interface of a sound card is limited to signals not carrying information in a constant DC component. Through arevisit of a card design for the (now defunct) ISA bus, thispaper proposes use of analog gates for bypassing the DCfiltering input sections, controllable from software - therebyallowing for arbitrary choice by the user, if a soundcardinput channel is to be used as a generic analog-to-digitalsensor interface.

This paperproposes an alternative approach based on pattern recognition and music prediction. Trained for a particular typeof music, here the Indian tabla drum, the system calledTablaNet identifies rhythmic patterns by recognizing individual strokes played by a musician and mapping them dynamically to known musical constructs. Symbols representing these musical structures are sent over the network toa corresponding computer system. The computer at thereceiving end anticipates incoming events by analyzing previous phrases and synthesizes an estimated audio output.Although such a system may introduce variants due to prediction approximations, resulting in a slightly different musical experience at both ends, we find that it demonstratesa high level of playability with an immediacy not present inother systems, and functions well as an educational tool.},

Several causes could explain this reality, among them the lack of a proper instrumental technique, inadequacy of the traditional musical notation and the non-existence of a repertoire dedicated to the instrument. In this paper we present Entoa, the first written music for Intonaspacio, a DMI we designed in our research project. We propose some strategies for mapping data from sensors to sound processing, in order to accomplish an expressive performance. Entoa is divided in five different sections that corresponds to five movements. For each, a different mapping is designed, introducing subtle alterations that progressively explore the ensemble of features of the instrument. The performer is then required to adapt his repertoire of gestures along the piece. Indications are expressed through a gestural notation, where freedom is give to performer to control certain parameters at specific moments in the music.},

Rhythm action games such as Dance Dance Revolution, Taiko No Tatsujin (Taiko: Drum Master), and Donkey Konga are stimulating collaborative gameplay and exposing consumers to custom controllers designed specifically for musical and physical interaction. We are witnessing the emergence and acceptance of these breakthrough controllers and models for gameplay as an international cultural phenomenon penetrating the video game and toy markets in record numbers.

Second, this interaction isn't direct but goes through a high level of abstraction: dancer's emotional expression is recognized and is the source of music generation.

abstract = {This paper presents a project that discusses a brief history of artistic systems that use photoresistors (light-dependent resistors) and results in the construction of an interface and performance controller. The controller combines an Arduino microcontroller with a grid of photoresistors set into a slab of wood covered with a thin acrylic sheet. A brief background on past uses of these components for music and film composition and instrument-building introduces a few different implementations and performance contexts for the controller. Topics such as implementation, construction, and performance possibilities (including electroacoustic and audio-visual performance) of the controller are also discussed.},

However, conventional methods for navigating these libraries are still quite rudimentary, and often involve scrolling through alphabetical lists. We present a system for sample exploration that allows audio clips to be sorted according to user taste, and arranged in any desired 2D formation such that similar samples are located near each other. Our method relies on two advances in machine learning. First, metric learning allows the user to shape the audio feature space to match their own preferences. Second, kernelized sorting finds an optimal arrangement for the samples in 2D. We demonstrate our system with two new interfaces for exploring audio samples, and evaluate the technology qualitatively and quantitatively via a pair of user studies.},

The aim of this paper is not to describe these programs, as they have been described elsewhere [14][15], but rather explicate the theoretical background that underlies the design of these screen-based instruments. After an analysis of the similarities and differences in the design of acoustic and screen-based instruments, the paper describes how the creation of an interface is essentially the creation of a semiotic system that affects and influences the musician and the composer. Finally the terminology of this semiotics is explained as an interaction model. },

abstract = {Computer music systems that coordinate or interact with human musicians exist in many forms. Often, coordination is at the level of gestures and phrases without synchronization at the beat level (or perhaps the notion of "beat" does not even exist). In music with beats, fine-grain synchronization can be achieved by having humans adapt to the computer (e.g. following a click track), or by computer accompaniment in which the computer follows a predetermined score. We consider an alternative scenario in which improvisation prevents traditional score following, but where synchronization is achieved at the level of beats, measures, and cues. To explore this new type of human-computer interaction, we have created new software abstractions for synchronization and coordination of music and interfaces in different modalities. We describe these new software structures, present examples, and introduce the idea of music notation as an interactive musical interface rather than a static document. },

abstract = {This paper describes two new live performance scenarios for performing music using bluetooth-enabled mobile phones. Interaction between mobile phones via wireless link is a key feature of the performance interface for each scenario. Both scenarios are discussed in the context of two publicly performed works for an ensemble of players in which mobile phone handsets are used both as sound sources and as hand-held controllers. In both works mobile phones are mounted in a specially devised pouch attached to a cord and physically swung to produce audio chorusing. During performance some players swing phones while others operate phones as hand-held controllers. Wireless connectivity enables interaction between flying and hand-held phones. Each work features different bluetooth implementations. In one a dedicated mobile phone acts as a server that interconnects multiple clients, while in the other point to point communication takes place between clients on an ad hoc basis. The paper summarises bluetooth tools designed for live performance realisation and concludes with a comparative evaluation of both scenarios for future implementation of performance by large ensembles of nonexpert players performing microtonal music using ubiquitous technology. },

The device uses capacitive sensing to detect proximity of the player's body to the metal object, and sound is generated through a surface transducer which can be attached to any flat surface. Because the capacitive sensor can be any shape or size, absolute capacitive thresholding is not possible since the baseline capacitance will change. Instead, we use a differential-based moving sum threshold which can rapidly adjust to changes in the environment or be re-calibrated to a new metal object. We show that this dynamic threshold is effective in rejecting environmental noise and rapidly adapting to new objects. We also present details for constructing Instant Instruments Anywhere, including using smartphone as the synthesis engine and power supply.},

The algorithm can detect common Western musicalstructures such as chords, arpeggios, scales, and trills as well as musicallyintended emotions: cheerful, mournful, vigorous, dreamy, lyrical, and humorouscompletely and solely based on low-sample-rate motion sensor data. Thealgorithm can be trained per performer in real-time or can work based onprevious training sets. The system maps the emotions to a color set andpresents them as a flowing emotional spectrum on the background of a pianoroll. This acts as a feedback mechanism for emotional expression as well as aninteractive display of the music. The system was trained and tested on a numberof pianists and it classified structures and emotions with promising results ofup to 92{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {CollideFx is a real-time audio effects processor that integrates the physics of real objects into the parameter space of the signal chain. Much like a traditional signal chain, the user can choose a series of effects and offer realtime control to their various parameters. In this work, we introduce a means of creating tree-like signal graphs that dynamically change their routing in response to changes in the location of the unit generators in a virtual space. Signals are rerouted using a crossfading scheme that avoids the harsh clicks and pops associated with amplitude discontinuities. The unit generators are easily controllable using a click and drag interface that responds using familiar physics. CollideFx brings the interactivity of a video game together with the purpose of creating interesting and complex audio effects. With little difficulty, users can craft custom effects, or alternatively, can fling a unit generator into a cluster of several others to obtain more surprising results, letting the physics engine do the decision making.},

abstract = {Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs) .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging. One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.},

abstract = {This paper presents a graph-theoretic model that supports the design andanalysis of data flow within digital musical instruments (DMIs). The state ofthe art in DMI design fails to provide any standards for the scheduling ofcomputations within a DMI's data flow. It does not provide a theoreticalframework within which we can analyze different scheduling protocols and theirimpact on the DMI's performance. Indeed, the mapping between the DMI's sensoryinputs and sonic outputs is classically treated as a black box. DMI designersand builders are forced to design and schedule the flow of data through thisblack box on their own. Improper design of the data flow can produceundesirable results, ranging from overflowing buffers that cause system crashesto misaligned sensory data that result in strange or disordered sonic events.In this paper, we attempt to remedy this problem by providing a framework forthe design and analysis of the DMI data flow. We also provide a schedulingalgorithm built upon that framework that guarantees desirable properties forthe resulting DMI.},

Driven by the interpersonal in- teractions amongst musicians, our system gives users, i.e., several musicians playing together in a band, real-time control over certain aspects of their performance, enabling them to change volume lev- els dynamically simply by moving around. It differs most notably from the majority of ventures into the design of novel musical in- terfaces and installations in its multidisciplinary approach, draw- ing on techniques from Human-Computer Interaction, social sci- ences and ludology. Our User-Centered Design methodology was central to producing an interactive environment that enhances tra- ditional performance with novel functionalities. During a formal experiment, musicians reported finding our system exciting and enjoyable. We also introduce some additional interactions that can further enhance the interactivity of our reactive environment. In describing the particular challenges of working with such a unique and creative user as the musician, we hope that our approach can be of guidance to interface developers working on applications of a creative nature.},

@inproceedings{Everman:2013,
abstract = {Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs) .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging. One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.},

Theimplemented system is based on an electric viola and asynthesis engine that is directly controlled by the unanalysedaudio signal of the instrument and indirectly by controlparameters mapped to the synthesis engine. This method offersa highly string-specific playability, as it is sensitive to thekinds of musical articulation produced by traditional playingtechniques. Nuances of sound variation applied by the playerwill be present in the output signal even if those nuances arebeyond traditionally measurable parameters like pitch,amplitude or brightness. The relatively minimal hardwarerequirements make the instrument accessible with littleexpenditure.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel music control sensate surface, which enables integration between any musical instruments with a v ersatile, customizable, and essentially cost-effective user interface. This sensate surface is based on c onductive inkjet printing technology which allows capacitive sensor electrodes and connections between electronics components to be printed onto a large roll of flexible substrate that is unrestricted in length. The high dynamic range capacitive sensing electrodes can not only infer touch, but near-range, non-contact gestural nuance in a music performance. With this sensate surface, users can ``cut'' out their desired shapes, ``paste'' the number of inputs, and customize their controller interface, which can then send signals wirelessly to effects or software synthesizers. We seek to find a solution for integrating the form factor of traditional music controllers seamlessly on top of one's music instrument and meanwhile adding expressiveness to the music performance by sensing and incorporating movements and gestures to manipulate the musical output. We present an example of implementation on an electric ukulele and provide several design examples to demonstrate the versatile capabilities of this system.},

The interface digitizes the output of the sensors into sets of high precision digital packets, and sends them to a patch running in Pdextended with a sufficiently high bandwidth for performances with almost no computational resource consumption in Pd. The precision, speed, and efficiency of the system enable the sonification of hand gestures in realtime without the need to attach any physical devices to the performer's body.

This creates a new way to combine the sonic richness of large sound corpora, easily accessible via navigation through a timbral descriptor space, with the intuitive gestural interaction with a surface, captured by any contact microphone. We use convolution to excite the grains from the corpus via the microphone input, capturing the contact interaction sounds, which allows articulation of the corpus by hitting, scratching, or strumming a surface with various parts of the hands or objects. We also show how changes of grains have to be carefully handled, how one can smoothly interpolate between neighbouring grains, and finally evaluate the system against previous attempts.},

@inproceedings{Donnarumma:2012,
abstract = {Performing music with a computer and loudspeakers represents always a challenge. The lack of a traditional instrument requires the performer to study idiomatic strategies by which musicianship becomes apparent. On the other hand, the audience needs to decode those strategies, so to achieve an understanding and appreciation of the music being played. The issue is particularly relevant to the performance of music that results from the mediation between biological signals of the human body and physical performance.
The present article tackles this concern by demonstrating a new model of musical performance; what I define biophysical music. This is music generated and played in real time by amplifying and processing the acoustic sound of a performer's muscle contractions. The model relies on an original and open source technology made of custom biosensors and a related software framework. The succesfull application of these tools is discussed in the practical context of a solo piece for sensors, laptop and loudspeakers. Eventually, the compositional strategies that characterize the piece are discussed along with a systematic description of the relevant mapping techniques and their sonic outcome.},

We present different strategies for extracting relevant postures and actions from the continuous data, and how these postures and actions can be used to control sonic and musical features. The system has been used in several public performances, and we believe it has great potential for further exploration. However, to overcome the current practical and technical challenges when working with the system, it is important to further refine tools and software in order to facilitate making of new performance pieces.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the process of appropriation in digital musical instrument performance, examining the effect of instrument complexity on the emergence of personal playing styles. Ten musicians of varying background were given a deliberately constrained musical instrument, a wooden cube containing a touch/force sensor, speaker and embedded computer. Each cube was identical in construction, but half the instruments were configured for two degrees of freedom while the other half allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video, sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive effect of reducing the exploration of the instrument's affordances; this suggested the presence of a dominant constraint in one of the two configurations which strongly differentiated the process of appropriation across the two groups of participants.},

The device can be swung freely and act as a full-fledged motionbased controller, as the game does not rely at all on visual feedback and the device display can thus be ignored.

In responding to the music and lighting you would activate more or different sounds and thereby communicate with the space through your body. This led to an artistic research project in which children's spontaneous movement was observed, a choreography made based on the children's movements and music written and recorded for the choreography. This music was then decomposed and choreographed into an empty space at Botkyrka konsthall creating an interactive dance installation. It was realized using an interactive sound and light system in which 5 video cameras were detecting the motion in the room connected to a 4-channel sound system and a set of 14 light modules. During five weeks people of all ages came to dance and move around in the installation. The installation attracted a wide range of people of all ages and the tentative evaluation indicates that it was very positively received and that it encouraged free movement in the intended way. Besides observing the activity in the installation interviews were made with schoolchildren age 7 who had participated in the installation. },

In this paper we propose an unsupervised offlinemethod that learns how to reduce and map the gestural data to a genericinstrument parameter control space. We make an unconventional use of theSelf-Organizing Maps to obtain only a geometrical transformation of thegestural data, while dimensionality reduction is handled separately. Weintroduce a novel training procedure to overcome two main Self- Organizing Mapslimitations which otherwise corrupt the interface usability. As evaluation, weapply this method to our existing Voice-Controlled Interface for musicalinstruments, obtaining sensible usability improvements.},

abstract = {The Overtone Fiddle is a new violin-family instrument that incorporates electronic sensors, integrated DSP, and physical actuation of the acoustic body. An embedded tactile sound transducer creates extra vibrations in the body of the Overtone Fiddle, allowing performer control and sensation via both traditional violin techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared man/machine control of the resulting sound. A magnetic pickup system is mounted to the end of the fiddle's fingerboard in order to detect the signals from the vibrating strings, deliberately not capturing vibrations from the full body of the instrument. This focused sensing approach allows less restrained use of DSP-generated feedback signals, as there is very little direct leakage from the actuator embedded in the body of the instrument back to the pickup. },

abstract = {This paper introduces `The Aesthetic Experience Prism', a framework for studying how components of aesthetic experience materialize in the model's of interaction of novel musical interfaces as well as how the role of aesthetics could be made more explicit in the processes of designing interaction for musical technologies. The Aesthetic Experience Prism makes use of Arthur Danto's framework of aesthetic experience that consists of three conceptual entities: (1) metaphor; (2) expression; and (3) style. In this paper we present key questions driving the research, theoretical background, artistic research approach and user research activities.
In the DIYSE project a proof-of-concept music creation system prototype was developed in a collaborative design setting. The prototype provides means to the performer to create music with minimum effort while allowing for versatile interaction. We argue that by using an artistic research approach specifically targeting designing for aesthetic experience we were able to transform the knowledge from early design ideas to resulting technology products in which model's of interaction metaphors, expression and style are in an apparent role.},

The SABRe projects intention is to be neither tied to its inventors nor to one single player but to offer a reference design for a larger community of bass clarinet players and composers. For this purpose, several instruments are made available and a number of composer residencies, workshops, presentations and concerts are organized.

As we will discuss, this extended computational matter-centric view is of benefit towards holistically understanding an ``instrument" gestural engagement, as it is realized through physical material, sonic gestural matter and felt human engagement.

MASD helps novice musicians in three ways. It removes the confusion that results from page turns, aides a musician's return to the proper location in the music score after the looking at the conductor and notifies musicians of conductor instructions. MASD is currently verified by evaluating the time between sending beats or conductor information and this information being rendered for the musician. Future work includes user testing of this system.
There are three major components to the MASD system. These components are Score Distribution, Score Rendering and Information Distribution. Score Distribution passes score information to clients and is facilitated by the Internet Communication Engine (ICE). Score Rendering uses the GUIDO Library to display the musical score. Information Distribution uses ICE and the IceStorm service to pass beat and instruction information to musicians.},

In this paper, we investigate the viability of predictingpercussion hits before they have occurred, so that information about thepredicted drum hit can be sent over a network, and the sound can be synthesizedat a receiver's location at approximately the same moment the hit occurs atthe sender's location. Such a system would allow two percussionists to playin perfect synchrony despite the delays caused by computer networks. Toinvestigate the feasibility of such an approach, we record vibraphone malletstrikes with a high-speed camera and track the mallet head position. We showthat 30 ms before the strike occurs, it is possible to predict strike time andvelocity with acceptable accuracy. Our method fits a second-order polynomial tothe data to produce a strike time prediction that is within the bounds ofperceptual synchrony, and a velocity estimate that will enable the soundpressure level of the synthesized strike to be accurate within 3 dB.},

Online users control physical outputs on a custom-designed cabinet that reflects their activity through a combination of motorized knobs and LEDs, and streams the resultant audio. In a typical installation, a composer creates a complex physical patch on the modular synth that exposes a set of analog and digital parameters (knobs, buttons, toggles, and triggers) to the web-enabled cabinet. Both physically present and online audiences can control those parameters, simultane- ously seeing and hearing the results of each other's actions. By enabling collaborative interaction with a massive analog synthesizer, Patchwerk brings a broad audience closer to a rare and historically important instrument.

The first one, called The Counterpointer, takes a melody input from the user and responds by generating voices based on the rules of eighteenth--century counterpoint. The second one is based on a recent treatise on harmony and counterpoint by music theorist Dmitri Tymoczco: El Ordenador lets users explore a set of features of tonality by constraining randomly generated music according to one or more of them. El Ordenador gives the user less control than The Counterpointer, but more than La Mec{\{}{\'{a}}{\}}nica, the third sequencer in the series.

The originality of this interaction is threefold. First, it covers the whole interaction cycle from the input (the dancer's movements) to the output (the generated music). Second, this interaction isn't direct but goes through a high level of abstraction: dancer's emotional expression is recognized and is the source of music generation. Third, this interaction has been designed and validated through constant collaboration with a choreographer, culminating in an augmented ballet performance in front of a live audience.},

The very modular and versatile archi- tecture makes possible new musical configurations and we tried the software with different styles and musical situa- tions. A novel visualization is proposed, which displays the current state of the learnt knowledge and allows to notice, both on the fly and a posteriori, points of musical interest and higher level structures.},

abstract = {Effective software interaction design must consider all of the capabilities and limitations of the platform for which it is developed. To this end, we propose a new model for computer music system design on touchscreen devices, combining both pen/stylus input and multitouch gestures. Such a model surpasses the barrier of touchscreen-based keyboard input, preserving the primary interaction of touch and direct manipulation throughout the development of a complex musical program. We have implemented an iPad software application utilizing these principles, called ``Auraglyph." Auraglyph offers a number of fundamental audio processing and control operators, as well as facilities for structured input and output. All of these software objects are created, parameterized, and interconnected via stylus and touch in- put. Underlying this application is an advanced handwriting recognition framework, LipiTk, which can be trained to recognize both alphanumeric characters and arbitrary figures, shapes, and patterns.},

In addition to pitch, vowels and voice strength control, Digitarticis designed for gestural control of articulation parameters for a wide set onconsonant, including various places and manners of articulation. The phases ofarticulation between two phonemes are continuously controlled and can bedriven in real time without noticeable delay, at any stage of the syntheticphoneme production. Thus, as in natural singing, very accurate rhythmicpatterns are produced and adapted while playing with other musicians. Theinstrument features two (augmented) pen tablets for controlling voiceproduction: one is dealing with the glottal source and vowels, the second oneis dealing with consonant/vowel articulation. The results show very naturalconsonant and vowel synthesis. Virtual choral practice confirms theeffectiveness of Digitartic as an expressive musical instrument.},

The presented work is part of a project aiming atmodeling movement-sound relationships, with the end goalof proposing novel approaches for designing musical instruments and sounding objects. The experiment is based onsound stimuli corresponding to "causal" and "non-causal"sounds. It is divided into a performance phase and an interview. The experiment is designed to investigate possiblecorrelation between the perception of the "causality" of environmental sounds and different gesture strategies for thesound embodiment. In analogy with the perception of thesounds' causality, we propose to distinguish gestures that"mimic" a sound's cause and gestures that "trace" a sound'smorphology following temporal sound characteristics. Results from the interviews show that, first, our causal soundsdatabase lead to consistent descriptions of the action at theorigin of the sound and participants mimic this action. Second, non-causal sounds lead to inconsistent metaphoric descriptions of the sound and participants make gestures following sound "contours". Quantitatively, the results showthat gesture variability is higher for causal sounds that noncausal sounds.},

The author reviews the guidelines proposed by other researchers and explains how they were concretely applied with the sponge. He concludes that no single strategy constitutes a solution to the issue of mapping and that musical compositions are complex entities that require the use of a multitude of mapping strategies in parallel. It is hoped that the mappings described combined with new strategies will eventually lead to the emergence of a musical language that is idiomatic to the sponge.},

For the purposes of this research a laptop ensemble is defined as a performing group of three or more musicians for whom the laptop is the main sound generating source and who typically perform together in the same room. The concept of democracy (i.e. governance by members of the group) has been used as a starting point to assess firstly what types of organisational structures are currently used in laptop ensembles and secondarily to what extent laptop ensembles consider the implications of organisational and social structure on their musical output. To assess this I recorded a number of data points including ensemble size, whether the group has a director or conductor, use of homogenous vs. heterogenous hardware and software, whether they perform composed pieces or mainly improvise, the level of network interaction and whether or not the ensemble has an academic affiliation. The survey allowed me to define a scale of democracy in laptop ensembles and typical features of the most and least democratic groups. Some examples are given of democratic and autocratic activity in existing laptop ensembles. This work is part of a larger scale project investigating the effect of social structures on the musical output of laptop ensembles.},

abstract = {Music plays a vital role in accompanying all manner of our experiences. Soundtracks within films, video games and ceremonies possess a unique ability to enhance a narrative, suggest emotional content and mark key transitions. Moreover, soundtracks often achieve all of this without being the primary focus, on the contrary they typically assume a supporting role. The proliferation of mobile devices increasingly leads us to listen to music while on the move and musicians are seizing on locative technologies as a tool for creating new kinds of music that directly respond to people's movements through space. In light of these trends, we consider the interesting question of how composers might set about creating musical soundtracks to accompany mobile experiences. What we have in mind are experiences such as guided walks, tours and even pervasive games. The novelty of our research here is in the music serving as an accompaniment to enhance a location specific activity, much as a soundtrack does for a film. This calls for composers to take into account the key features of the experience, and its setting, to gently complement them through the music. We examine this process from a composer's perspective by presenting `from the field' an account of how they address the multifaceted challenges of designing a soundtrack for public sculpture park. We chart a composer's rationale as they developed a soundtrack for this site over multiple iterations of design, testing and refinement. We expose key relationships between the raw materials of music (melody, harmony, timbre, rhythm and dynamics) and those of the physical setting, that enable the composer to gracefully mesh the music into the fabric of the space. The result is to propose a set of recommendations to inform the composition of mobile soundtracks that we intend to guide future practice and research.},

Informal evaluation was obtained from a Reactable expert user, regarding these sets ofobjects. Experiments with the objects were also performed- related to both audio filtering, and interfacing with otherobjects for the Reactable.},

In addition to musical parameters such as pitch and loudness, our system is able to analyze timbral characteristics of the saxophone tone in real-time, and use timbral information to guide the generation of response material. We capture each saxophone gesture on the fly, extract a set of gestural and timbral contours, and store them in a repository. Improvising agents can consult the repository when generating responses. The gestural or timbral progression of a saxophone phrase can be remapped or transformed; this enables a variety of response material that also references audible contours of the original saxophone gestures. A single simple framework is used to manage gestural and timbral information extracted from analysis, and for expressive control of virtual instruments in a free improvisation context. },

abstract = {Several new technologies to capture motion, gesture and forces for musical instrument players' analyses have been developed in the last years. In research and for augmented instruments one parameter is underrepresented so far. It is finger position and pressure measurement, applied by the musician while playing the musical instrument. In this paper we show a flexible linear-potentiometer and forcesensitive-resistor (FSR) based solution for position, pressure and force sensing between the contact point of the fingers and the musical instrument. A flexible matrix printed circuit board (PCB) is fixed on a piano key. We further introduce linear potentiometer based left hand finger position sensing for string instruments, integrated into a violin and a guitar finger board. Several calibration and measurement scenarios are shown. The violin sensor was evaluated with 13 music students regarding playability and robustness of the system. Main focus was a the integration of the sensors into these two traditional musical instruments as unobtrusively as possible to keep natural haptic playing sensation. The musicians playing the violin in different performance situations stated good playability and no differences in the haptic sensation while playing. The piano sensor is rated, due to interviews after testing it in a conventional keyboard quite unobtrusive, too, but still evokes a different haptic sensation.},

Drawing on a critical literature in studies of material culture, the work incorporated data sonification, image audification, field recordings and created a number of instruments for exploring geological artefacts and meterological data as aesthetic material. The residency culminated in an exhibition presented as a 'sensorium' for the sensory exploration of museum objects. In describing the methods and thinking behind the project this paper presents an alternative approach to engaging artists and audiences with local heritage and museum archives, which draws on research in NIME and allied literatures, and which is devoted to enlivening collections as occasions for varied interpretation, appropriation and aesthetic response.},

abstract = {This paper describes the theoretical underpinnings, design, and development of a hyper--instrumental performance system driven by gestural data obtained from an electric guitar. The system combines a multichannel audio feed from the guitar (which is parsed for its pitch, spectral content and note inter--onset time data to provide abstractions of sounded performance gestures) with motion tracking of the performer's larger--scale bodily movements using a Microsoft Xbox Kinect sensor. These gestural materials are used to provide the basis for the structures of relational mappings, informed by the embodied image schema structures of Lakoff and Johnson. These theoretical perspectives are refined via larger-scale ecological-embodied structural relationships in electroacoustic music outlined in Smalley's theory of spectromorphology, alongside the incorporation of an additional active-agential response structure through the use of the boids flocking algorithm by Reynolds to control the spatialization of outputs and other textural processes. The paper aims to advance a broadly-applicable 'performance gesture ecology', providing a shared spatial-relational mapping (a 'basic gestural space') which allows for creative (but still coherent) mappings from the performance gestures to the control of textural and spatial structures.},

Usually, pitch is set at thecontact point on the interface, thus introducing possible pitch inaccuracies atthe note onset. This paper proposes a new algorithm, based on an adaptiveattraction mapping, for improving initial pitch accuracy with touch userinterfaces with continuous control. At each new contact on the interface, thealgorithm adjusts the mapping to produce the most likely targeted note of thescale in the vicinity of the contact point. Then, pitch remains continuouslyadjustable as long as the contact is maintained, allowing for vibrato,portamento and other subtle melodic control. The results of experimentscomparing the users' pitch accuracy with and without the help of the algorithmshow that such a correction enables to play sharply in tune at the contact withthe interface, regardless the musical background of the player. Therefore, thedynamic mapping algorithm allows for a clean and accurate attack when playing touch user interfaces for controlling continuous pitch instruments like voicesynthesizers.},

Such a system would allow two percussionists to playin perfect synchrony despite the delays caused by computer networks. Toinvestigate the feasibility of such an approach, we record vibraphone malletstrikes with a high-speed camera and track the mallet head position. We showthat 30 ms before the strike occurs, it is possible to predict strike time andvelocity with acceptable accuracy. Our method fits a second-order polynomial tothe data to produce a strike time prediction that is within the bounds ofperceptual synchrony, and a velocity estimate that will enable the soundpressure level of the synthesized strike to be accurate within 3 dB.},

abstract = {This paper presents a system for exploring different dimensions of a soundthrough the use of haptic feedback. The Novint Falcon force feedback interfaceis used to scan through soundfiles as a subject moves their hand horizontallyfrom left to right, and to relay information about volume, frequency content,noisiness, or potentially any analysable parameter back to the subject throughforces acting on their hand. General practicalities of mapping sonic elements to physical forces areconsidered, such as the problem of representing detailed data through vaguephysical sensation, approaches to applying forces to the hand that do notinterfering with the smooth operation of the device, and the relative merits ofdiscreet and continuous mappings. Three approaches to generating the forcevector are discussed: 1) the use of simulated detents to identify areas of anaudio parameter over a certain threshold, 2) applying friction proportional tothe level of the audio parameter along the axis of movement, and 3) creatingforces perpendicular to the subject's hand movements.Presentation of audio information in this manner could be beneficial for`pre-feeling' as a method for selecting material to play during a liveperformance, assisting visually impaired audio engineers, and as a generalaugmentation of standard audio editing environments.},

abstract = {This work presents a general framework method for cre-ating spatialization systems focused on electroacoustic andacousmatic music performance and creation. Although weused the logistic equation as orbit generator, any dynami-cal system could be suitable. The main idea lies on generating vectors of Rn with entriesfrom data series of di{\_}x000B{\_}erent orbits from an speci{\_}x000C{\_}c dynami-cal system. Such vectors will be called system vectors. Ourproposal is to create ordered paths between those pointsor system vectors using the Splines Quark library by Felix,1which allow us to generate smooth curves joining the points.Finally, interpolating that result with a {\_}x000C{\_}xed sample value,we are able to obtain speci{\_}x000C{\_}c and independent multidimen-sional panning trajectories for each speaker array and forany number of sound sources.Our contribution is intended to be at the very root of the compositionalprocess giving to the creator a method for exploring new ways for spatialsound placement over time for a wide range of speakers ar-rangements. The advantage of using controlled chaotic dy-namical systems like the logistic equation, lies on the factthat the composer can freely and consciously choose be-tween stable or irregular behaviour for the orbits that willgenerate his/her panning trajectories. Besides, with the useof isometries, it is possible to generate di{\_}x000B{\_}erent related or-bits with one single evaluation of the system. The use ofthe spline method in SuperCollider allows the possibilityof joining and relating those values from orbits into a wellde{\_}x000C{\_}ned and coherent general system. Further research willinclude controlling synthesis parameters in the same waywe created panning trajectories.},

abstract = {We present an interactive content-based MIR environment specifically designedto aid in the exploration of databases of experimental electronic music,particularly in cases where little or no metadata exist. In recent years,several rare archives of early experimental electronic music have becomeavailable. The Daphne Oram Collection contains one such archive, consisting ofapproximately 120 hours of 1/4 inch tape recordings and representing a perioddating from circa 1957. This collection is recognized as an importantmusicological resource, representing aspects of the evolution of electronicmusic practices, including early tape editing methods, experimental synthesistechniques and composition. However, it is extremely challenging to derivemeaningful information from this dataset, primarily for three reasons. First,the dataset is very large. Second, there is limited metadata - some titles,track lists, and occasional handwritten notes exist, but where this is true,the reliability of the annotations are unknown. Finally, and mostsignificantly, as this is a collection of early experimental electronic music,the sonic characteristics of the material are often not consistent withtraditional musical information. In other words, there is no score, no knowninstrumentation, and often no recognizable acoustic source. We present amethod for the construction of a frequency component dictionary derived fromthe collection via Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA), anddemonstrate how an interactive 3D visualization of the relationships betweenthe PLCA-derived dictionary and the archive is facilitating researcher'sunderstanding of the data.},

abstract = {In site-specific installation or situated media, a significant part of the "I" in NIME is the environment, the site and the implicit features of site such as humans, weather, materials, natural acoustics, etc. These could be viewed as design constraints, or features, even agency determining the outcome of responsive sound installation works. This paper discusses the notion of interface in public (especially outdoor) installation, starting with the authors' Sculpture by the Sea Windtraces work using this recent experience as the launch-pad, with reference to ways in which others have approached it (focusing on sensor, weather-activated outdoor installations in a brief traverse of related cases, e.g. works by Garth Paine, James Bulley and Daniel Jones, and David Bowen). This is a dialogical paper on the topic of interface and `site' as the aetiology of interaction/interface/instrument and its type of response (e.g. to environment and audience). While the focus here is on outdoor factors (particularly the climatic environment), indoor site- specific installation also experiences the effects of ambient noise, acoustic context, and audience as integral agents in the interface and perception of the work, its musical expression. The way in which features of the situation are integrated has relevance for others in the NIME community in the design of responsive spaces, art installation, and large-scale or installed instruments in which users, participants, acoustics play a significant role.},

Artists and sound designers who are interested in accessing that data to make music must currently possess low-level knowledge of Internet protocols and spend signifi-cant effort working with low-level networking code. We have created SonNet, a new software tool that lowers these practical barriers to experimenting and composing with network data. SonNet executes packet-sniffng and network connection state analysis automatically, and it includes an easy-touse ChucK object that can be instantiated, customized, and queried from a user's own code. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the SonNet system, and we discuss a pilot evaluation of the system with computer music composers. We also discuss compositional applications of SonNet and illustrate the use of the system in an example composition.},

The paper discusses the aims and objectives of the system, elucidates the design decisions, and introduces in particular the code score feature present in the Threnoscope. The code score is a novel element in the design of live coding systems allowing for improvisation through a graphic score, rendering a visual representation of past and future events in a real-time performance.

It is well described in the literature, but has been rarely examined for its capacity as a new interface for musical expression. The interesting outcome of such an examination is that the actual instrument is the space of sound characteristics, through which the performer navigates with gestures captured by various input devices. We will take a look at different types of interaction modes and controllers (positional, inertial, audio analysis) and the gestures they afford, and provide a critical assessment of their musical and expressive capabilities, based on several years of musical experience, performing with the CataRT system for real-time CBCS.},

The musicians control the musicalcontent and structure of the song thanks to an interface relying on the freeinking metaphor. One contribution of this interface is that it displays musicalpatterns of different lengths in the same space. The design of Jam On is basedon a list of performance criteria aimed at ensuring the musicality of theperformance and the interactivity of the technical system.

Automated music performance is a form of music production using programmed musical notes. Some artists who introduce automated music performance operate parameters of the sound in their performance for production of their music. In this paper, we focus on the music production aspects and describe a method that realizes operation of the sound parameters via computer. Further, in this study, the probability distribution of the action (i.e., variation of parameters) is obtained within the music, using Bayesian filters. The probability distribution of each piece of music is transformed by passing through a Markov model. After the probability distribution is obtained, sound parameters can be automatically controlled. We have developed a system to reproduce the musical expressions of humans and confirmed the possibilities of our method.},

Scenes that make it possible for the user to select, explore and recreate different ``sound worlds" with the tangible interface as an instrument; create and play with it as a friend; improvise and create; or relax with it as an ambient sounding furniture. We continue discussing a user story, how the Scenes are recreated by amateur users, persons with severe disabilities and family members; improvising with the mobile tangibles. We discuss composition techniques for mixing sound, tangible-physical and lighting elements in the Scenes. Based on observations we explore how a diverse audience in the family and at school can recreate and improvise their own sound experience and play together with others. We conclude by discussing the possible impact of our findings for the NIME-community; how the techniques of decomposing, recomposing and recreating sound, based on a relational perspective, could contribute to the design of new instruments for musical expression.},

The goal of the system is to allow people with no to little musicalbackground to play a song collaboratively. The musicians control the musicalcontent and structure of the song thanks to an interface relying on the freeinking metaphor. One contribution of this interface is that it displays musicalpatterns of different lengths in the same space. The design of Jam On is basedon a list of performance criteria aimed at ensuring the musicality of theperformance and the interactivity of the technical system. The paper comparestwo alternative interfaces used for the system and explores the various stagesof the design process aimed at making the system as musical and interactive aspossible.},

The work described in this paper has been motivated by three applications: computer analysis of Gyil performance, live improvised electro-acoustic music incorporating the Gyil, and hybrid sampling and physical mod- eling. In all three of these cases, detailed information about what is played on the Gyil needs to be digitally captured in real-time. We describe a direct sensing apparatus that can be used to achieve this. It is based on contact microphones and is informed by the specific characteristics of the Gyil. An alternative approach based on indirect acquisition is to apply polyphonic transcription on the signal acquired by a microphone without requiring the instrument to be modified. The direct sensing apparatus we have developed can be used to acquire ground truth for evaluating different approaches to polyphonic transcription and help create a ``surrogate'' sensor. Some initial results comparing different strategies to polyphonic transcription are presented.},

However, those platforms typically target everyday programmers rather than composers and media artists. On the other hand, tangible user interface (TUI) toolkits, which provide an integrated, easy-to-use solution have not gained momentum in modern music creation. We propose a concept that hybridizes physical computing and TUI toolkit approaches. This helps to tackle typical TUI toolkit weaknesses, namely quick sensor obsolescence and limited choices. We developed a physical realization based on the idea of "universal pins," which can be configured to perform a variety of duties, making it possible to connect different sensor breakouts and modules. We evaluated our prototype by making performance measurements and conducting a user study demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.},

As objects change position and appearance, Mira makes sure that theinterface on the iPad is kept up to date. Mira eliminates the need for anexplicit mapping step between the interface and the system being controlled.The user is never asked to input an IP address, nor to configure the mappingbetween interface objects on the iPad and those in the Max patcher. So theprototyping composer is free to rapidly configure and reconfigure theinterface.},

abstract = {The Physical Computing Ensemble was created in order to determine the viability of an approach to musical performance which focuses on the relationships and interactions of the performers. Three performance systems utilizing gestural controllers were designed and implemented, each with a different strategy for performer interaction.
These strategies took advantage of the opportunities for collaborative performance inherent in digital musical instruments due to their networking abilities and reconfigurable software. These characteristics allow for the easy implementation of varying approaches to collaborative performance. Ensembles who utilize digital musical instruments provide a fertile environment for the design, testing, and utilization of collaborative performance systems.
The three strategies discussed in this paper are the parameterization of musical elements, turn-based collaborative control of sound, and the interaction of musical systems created by multiple performers. Design principles, implementation, and a performance using these strategies are discussed, and the conclusion is drawn that performer interaction and collaboration as a primary focus for system design, composition, and performance is viable.},

In this paper we show a flexible linear-potentiometer and forcesensitive-resistor (FSR) based solution for position, pressure and force sensing between the contact point of the fingers and the musical instrument. A flexible matrix printed circuit board (PCB) is fixed on a piano key. We further introduce linear potentiometer based left hand finger position sensing for string instruments, integrated into a violin and a guitar finger board. Several calibration and measurement scenarios are shown. The violin sensor was evaluated with 13 music students regarding playability and robustness of the system. Main focus was a the integration of the sensors into these two traditional musical instruments as unobtrusively as possible to keep natural haptic playing sensation. The musicians playing the violin in different performance situations stated good playability and no differences in the haptic sensation while playing. The piano sensor is rated, due to interviews after testing it in a conventional keyboard quite unobtrusive, too, but still evokes a different haptic sensation.},

A wireless microphone has been augmented with six momentary switches, one fader, and three axes of motion and position sensors, all of which provide MIDI output from the wireless receiver. The MIDI data is used to control external vocal effects units such as live loopers, reverbs, distortion pedals, etc. The goal was to to provide dramatically increased expressive control to vocal performances, and address some of the shortcomings of pedal-controlled effects. The addition of gestural controls from the motion sensors opens up new performance possibilities such as panning the voice simply by pointing the microphone in one direction or another. The result is a hybrid microphone-musical instrument which has recieved extremely positive results from vocalists in numerous infor- mal workshops.},

abstract = {Mapping between musical interfaces, and sound engines, is integral to the nature of an interface [3]. Traditionally, mu- sical applications for touch surfaces have directly mapped touch coordinates to control parameters. However, recent work [9] is looking at new methods of control that use rela- tional multi-point analysis. Instead of directly using touch coordinates, which are related to a global screen space, an initial touch is used as an `anchor' to create a local coor- dinate space in which subsequent touches can be located and compared. This local coordinate space frees touches from being locked to one single relationship, and allows for more complex interaction between touch events. So far, this method has only been implemented on Apple computer's small capacitive touch pads. Additionally, there has yet to be a user study that directly compares [9] against mappings of touch events within global coordinate spaces. With this in mind, we have developed and evaluated two interfaces with the aim of determining and quantifying some of these differences within the context of our custom large mutli- touch surfaces [1].},

Not only does this research enable us to closely examine thecommunicative aspects of performance, it also allows us to explore newinterpretations of the network as a performance space.

abstract = {Maintaining a sense of personal connection between increasingly synthetic performers and increasingly diffuse audiences is vital to storytelling and entertainment. Sonic intimacy is important, because voice is one of the highestbandwidth channels for expressing our real and imagined selves.New tools for highly focused spatialization could help improve acoustical clarity, encourage audience engagement, reduce noise pollution and inspire creative expression. We have a particular interest in embodied, embedded systems for vocal performance enhancement and transformation. This short paper describes work in progress on a toolkit for high-quality wearable sound suits. Design goals include tailored directionality and resonance, full bandwidth, and sensible ergonomics. Engineering details to accompany a demonstration of recent prototypes are presented, highlighting a novel magnetostrictive flextensional transducer. Based on initial observations we suggest that vocal acoustic output from the torso, and spatial perception of situated low frequency sources, are two areas deserving greater attention and further study.},

The work is based on---but also departs from---John Cage's Reunion, which premiered at the Sightsoundsystems Festival, Toronto, 1968. In the original performance, Cage and Marcel Duchamp played chess on an electronic board constructed by Lowell Cross. The board `conducted' various electronic sound sources played by Cross, Gordon Mumma, David Tudor, and David Behrman, using photoresistors fitted under the squares [1]. Reunion2012, on the other hand, utilises magnet sensors via an Arduino. Like in Cage's Variations V, this resulted in a musical situation where the improvis- ing musicians had full control over their own sound, but no control regarding when their sound may be heard. In addition to a concert version, this paper also describes an interactive installation based on the same hardware.},

I suggest that practice-led methods, by dint of focussing on the lived experience where many of these topics converge, may be able to serve as a useful methodological `glue' for NIME by helping stimulate useful agonistic discussion on our objects of study, and map the untidy contours of contemporary practices. I contextualise this discussion by presenting two recently developed improvisation systems and drawing from these some starting suggestions for how attention to the grain of lived practice could usefully contribute to considerations for designers in terms of the pursuit of musicality and the care required in considering performances in evaluation.},

abstract = {We introduce and describe the initial evaluation of a new low-cost augmented violin prototype, with research focused on the user experience when playing such hybrid physical-digital instruments, and the exploration of novel interactive performance techniques. Another goal of this work is wider platform accessibility for players, via a simple `do-it-yourself' approach described by the design herein. While the hardware and software elements are open source, the build process can nonetheless require non-insignificant investments of time and money, as well as basic electronics construction skills. These have been kept to a minimum wherever possible. Our initial prototype is based upon an inexpensive electric violin that is widely available online for approximately 200 USD. This serves as the starting point for construction, to which the design adds local Digital Signal Processing (DSP), gestural sensing, and sound output. Real-time DSP algorithms are running on a mobile device, which also incorporates orientation/gesture sensors for parameter mapping, with the resulting sound amplified and rendered via small loudspeakers mounted on the instrument. The platform combines all necessary elements for digitally-mediated interactive performance; the need for a traditional computer only arises when developing new DSP algorithms for the platform. An initial exploratory evaluation with users is presented, in which performers explore different possibilities with the proposed platform (various DSP implementations, mapping schemes, physical setups, etc.) in order to better establish the needs of the performing artist. Based on these results, future work is outlined leading towards the development of a complete quartet of instruments.},

These interfaces work well when the movement and sound are smooth and continuous, but it has proven difficult to design a system which triggers discrete sounds with precision that allows for complex rhythmic performance. We conducted a study where participants perform ``air-drumming" gestures in time to rhythmic sounds. These movements are recorded, and the timing of various movement features with respect to the onset of audio events is analyzed. A novel algorithm for detecting sudden changes in direction is used to find the end of the strike gesture. We find that these occur on average after the audio onset and that this timing varies with the tempo of the movement. Sharp peaks in magnitude acceleration occur before the audio onset and do not vary with tempo. These results suggest that detecting peaks in acceleration will lead to more naturally responsive air gesture instruments.},

Hidden parameters like force, pressure and fast movements, happening within milliseconds are particularly difficult to capture. Here, we present data focusing on movement coordination parameters of the left hand fingers with the bow hand in violinists and between two violinists in group playing. Data was recorded with different position sensors, a micro camcorder fixed on a violin and an acceleration sensor placed on the bow. Sensor measurements were obtained at a high sampling rate, gathering the data with a small mi-crocontroller unit, connected with a laptop computer. To capture bow's position, rotation and angle directly on the bow to string contact point, the micro camcorder was fixed near the bridge. Main focuses of interest were the changes of the left hand finger, the temporal synchronization between left hand fingers with the right hand, the close up view to the bow to string contact point and the contact of the left hand finger and/or string to the fingerboard. Seven violinists, from beginners to master class students played scales in different rhythms, speeds and bowings and music excerpts of free choice while being recorded. One measure-ment with 2 violinists was made to see the time differences between two musicians while playing together. For simple integration of a conventional violin into electronic music environments, left hand sensor data were exemplary converted to MIDI and OSC.},

This information is used for piece-wise integration of the accelerometer signal, resulting in a drift-free reconstructed velocity signal with a high temporal resolution. The method was evaluated using a 3D motion capturing system, providing a reliable reference of the actual bow velocity. The method showed good results when the accelerometer and video stream are synchronized. Additional latency and jitter of the camera stream can importantly decrease the performance of the method, depending on the bow stroke type. },

abstract = {This paper introduces `The Aesthetic Experience Prism', a framework for studying how components of aesthetic experience materialize in the model's of interaction of novel musical interfaces as well as how the role of aesthetics could be made more explicit in the processes of designing interaction for musical technologies. The Aesthetic Experience Prism makes use of Arthur Danto's framework of aesthetic experience that consists of three conceptual entities: (1) metaphor; (2) expression; and (3) style. In this paper we present key questions driving the research, theoretical background, artistic research approach and user research activities.
In the DIYSE project a proof-of-concept music creation system prototype was developed in a collaborative design setting. The prototype provides means to the performer to create music with minimum effort while allowing for versatile interaction. We argue that by using an artistic research approach specifically targeting designing for aesthetic experience we were able to transform the knowledge from early design ideas to resulting technology products in which model's of interaction metaphors, expression and style are in an apparent role.},

Our research aims in understanding the motor control from an engineering point of view and enabling the communication. In this paper, the Waseda Saxophone Robot No. 2 (WAS-2) which is composed by 22-DOFs is detailed. The lip mechanism of WAS-2 has been designed with 3-DOFs to control the motion of the lower, upper and sideway lips. In addition, a human-like hand (16 DOF-s) has been designed to enable to play all the keys of the instrument. Regarding the improvement of the control system, a feed-forward control system with dead-time compensation has been implemented to assure the accurate control of the air pressure. In addition, the implementation of an auditory feedback control system has been proposed and implemented in order to adjust the positioning of the physical parameters of the components of the robot by providing a pitch feedback and defining a recovery position (off-line). A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements and the dynamic response of the air pressure. As a result, the range of sound pressure has been increased and the proposed control system improved the dynamic response of the air pressure control. },

@inproceedings{Park:2013,
abstract = {"Since Euler's development of the Tonnetz in 1739, musicians, composers andinstrument designers have been fascinated with the concept of musicalisomorphism, the idea that by arranging tones by their harmonic relationshipsrather than by their physical properties, the common shapes of musicalconstructs will appear, facilitating learning and new ways of exploringharmonic spaces. The construction of isomorphic instruments, beyond limitedsquare isomorphisms present in many stringed instruments, has been a challengein the past for two reasons: The first problem, that of re-arranging noteactuators from their sounding elements, has been solved by digital instrumentdesign. The second, more conceptual problem, is that only a single isomorphismcan be designed for any one instrument, requiring the instrument designer (aswell as composer and performer) to ""lock in"" to a single isomorphism, or tohave a different instrument for each isomorphism in order to experiment. Musix(an iOS application) and Rainboard (a physical device) are two new musicalinstruments built to overcome this and other limitations of existing isomorphicinstruments. Musix was developed to allow experimentation with a wide varietyof different isomorphic layouts, to assess the advantages and disadvantages ofeach. The Rainboard consists of a hexagonal array of arcade buttons embeddedwith RGB-LEDs, which are used to indicate characteristics of the isomorphismcurrently in use on the Rainboard. The creation of these two instruments /experimentation platforms allows for isomorphic layouts to be explored in waysthat are not possible with existing instruments."},

The relative activity between different types of activity isassessed in order to identify trends. The classification according totechnological, social or geographic showed an overwhelming bias to thetechnological, followed by social investigations. An alternative classificationof survey product, or artifact reveals an increase in the number of productsdescribed with a corresponding decline in the number of surveys and artisticprojects. The increase in technical papers appears to be due to an enthusiasmto make use of increased capability of mobile phones, although there are signsthat the initial interest has already peaked, and researchers are againinterested to explore technologies and artistic expression beyond existingmobile phones.},

Hidden parameters like force, pressure and fast movements, happening within milliseconds are particularly difficult to capture. Here, we present data focusing on movement coordination parameters of the left hand fingers with the bow hand in violinists and between two violinists in group playing. Data was recorded with different position sensors, a micro camcorder fixed on a violin and an acceleration sensor placed on the bow. Sensor measurements were obtained at a high sampling rate, gathering the data with a small mi- crocontroller unit, connected with a laptop computer. To capture bow's position, rotation and angle directly on the bow to string contact point, the micro camcorder was fixed near the bridge. Main focuses of interest were the changes of the left hand finger, the temporal synchronization between left hand fingers with the right hand, the close up view to the bow to string contact point and the contact of the left hand finger and/or string to the fingerboard. Seven violinists, from beginners to master class students played scales in different rhythms, speeds and bowings and music excerpts of free choice while being recorded. One measure- ment with 2 violinists was made to see the time differences between two musicians while playing together. For simple integration of a conventional violin into electronic music environments, left hand sensor data were exemplary converted to MIDI and OSC.},

This language can be edited on the touchscreen of an Android phone, allowing the grammar to be modified live in performance situations.Interactive scanning of the score is visible to the audience asa performance interface, with a colour classifier and visual feature recogniser causing the grammar-specified events to be sent using OSC messages via Wi-Fi from the hand-held smartphone to an audio workstation.},

abstract = {Capacitive touch sensing is increasingly used in musical con- trollers, particularly those based on multi-touch screen interfaces. However, in contrast to the venerable piano-style keyboard, touch screen controllers lack the tactile feedback many performers find crucial. This paper presents an augmentation system for acoustic and electronic keyboards in which multi-touch capacitive sensors are added to the surface of each key. Each key records the position of fingers on the surface, and by combining this data with MIDI note onsets and aftertouch from the host keyboard, the system functions as a multidimensional polyphonic controller for a wide variety of synthesis software. The paper will discuss general capacitive touch sensor design, keyboard-specific implementation strategies, and the development of a flexible mapping engine using OSC and MIDI.},

Recently, more effort has been put into making it more and more accessible to instrument designers.This paper covers some of these technologies with the aimof helping instrument designers add haptic feedback to theirinstruments. We begin by giving a brief overview of practicalactuators. Next, we compare and contrast using embeddedmicrocontrollers versus general purpose computers as controllers. Along the way, we mention some common softwareenvironments for implementing control algorithms. Then wediscuss the fundamental haptic control algorithms as well assome more complex ones. Finally, we present two practicaland effective haptic musical instruments: the haptic drumand the Cellomobo.},

The motion of the subjects breathing is trackedand interpreted as a real-time variable tempo adjustment toa stored musical file. The subject can then adjust his/herbreathing to synchronize with a separate accompanimentline. When the breathing is regular and is at the desiredtempo, the audible result sounds synchronous and harmonious. The accompaniment's tempo progresses and gradually decrease which causes the breathing to synchronize andslow down, thus increasing relaxation.},

The system described, Kinetic Engine, is an environment in which individual software agents, emulate drummers improvising within a percussion ensemble. Player agents assume roles and personalities within the ensemble, and communicate with one another to create complex rhythmic interactions. In this project, the ensemble is comprised of a 12-armed musical robot, MahaDeviBot, in which each limb has its own software agent controlling what it performs. },

We also develop live variable view that communicates live changes in state among live coders, networked performers, and the audience. Lastly, we integrate collaborative aspects of programming execution into built-in live chat, which enables not only communication with others, but also distributed execution of code.},

The themes of visibility, risk, and embodiment, as formulated by Klemmer, are shown to be implicitly present in this design task.

The trajectory ofcircular motion drawn by the performance and the momentum of the mPoiinstrument are converted to the energetic and vibrant sound, which makesspiritual and meditative soundscape that opens everyone up the aura and clearsthe thought forms away. The mPoi project and its concepts will be introducedfirst and then its interaction with a performer will be discussed.The mPoi project seeks to develop a prototype for a set of mobile musicalinstrument based on electronic motion sensors and circuit boards. Thistechnology is installed in egg-shaped structure and allows communicationbetween a performer and the mPoi instrument. The principal motivation for themPoi project has been a desire to develop an extensible interface that willsupport the Poi performance, which is a style of performance art originatedwith the Maori people of New Zealand involving swinging tethered weightsthrough a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns. As an extension of the body and the expansion of the movement, the mPoiutilizes the creative performance of Poi to make spatial and spiritual soundand music. The aims of the mPoi project are:to create a prototype of mPoi instrument that includes circuit board thatconnects the instrument to a sensor.to develop a software, which includes programming of the circuit board and forthe sound generation.to make a new artistic expression to refine the captured sound into artisticmusical notes. The creative part of the project is to design a unique method to translate theperformer's gesture into sound. A unique algorithm was developed to extractfeatures of the swing motion and translate them into various patterns of sound.},

We found that even highly computer-literate composers use an iterative process that begins with expressing musical ideas on paper, followed by active parallel exploration on paper and in software, prior to final execution of their ideas as an original score. We conducted a participatory design study that focused on the creative exploration phase, to design tools that help composers better integrate their paper-based and electronic activities. We then developed InkSplorer as a technology probe that connects users' hand-written gestures on paper to Max/MSP and OpenMusic. Composers appropriated InkSplorer according to their preferred composition styles, emphasizing its ability to help them quickly explore musical ideas on paper as they interact with the computer. We conclude with recommendations for designing interactive paper tools that support the creative process, letting users explore musical ideas both on paper and electronically. },

While respiration is frequently considered as an indicator of the metabolic state of human body that contains meaningful information for medicine or psychology, motional aspect of respiration has been relatively unnoticed in spite of its strong correlation with muscles and the brain.
This paper introduces an interactive system to control music playback for dance performances based on the respiration pattern of the dancer. A wireless wearable sensor device detects the dancer's respiration, which is then utilized to modify the dynamic of music. Two different respiration-dynamic mappings were designed and evaluated through public performances and private tests by professional choreographers. Results from this research suggest a new conceptual approach to musical applications of respiration based on the technical characteristics of music and dance.},

A three-dimensional distribution derived from feature-analysis becomes accessible through a theremin-inspired interface, allowing the player to shift from exploration and intuitive navigation toward embodied performance on a granular level. In our example we illustrate this concept by using the audiovisual recording of an instrumental performance as a source. Our system provides an alternative interface to the musical instrument's audiovisual corpus: as the instrument's sound and behavior is accessed in ways that are not possible on the instrument itself, the resulting non-linear playback of the grains generates an instant remix in a cut-up aesthetic. The presented instrument is a human-computer interface that employs the structural outcome of machine analysis accessing audiovisual corpora in the context of a musical performance.},

abstract = {One problem with live computer music performance is the transport of computers to a venue and the following setup of the computers used in playing and rendering music. The more computers involved the longer the setup and tear-down of a performance. Each computer adds power and cabling requirements that the venue must accommodate. Cloud computing can change of all this by simplifying the setup of many (10s, 100s) of machines at the click of a button. But there's a catch, the cloud is not physically near you, you cannot run an audio cable to the cloud. The audio from a computer music instrument in the cloud needs to streamed back to the performer and listeners. There are many solutions for streaming audio over networks and the internet, most of them suffer from high latency, heavy buffering, or proprietary/non-portable clients. In this paper we propose a portable cloud-friendly method of streaming, almost a cloud soundcard, whereby performers can use mobile devices (Android, iOS, laptops) to stream audio from the cloud with far lower latency than technologies like icecast. This technology enables near-realtime control over power computer music networks enabling performers to travel light and perform live with more computers than ever before.},

abstract = {In the paper I present a robotic device that offers new ways of interaction for producing rhythmic patterns. The apparatus is placed on an overhead projector and a visual presentation of these rhythmic patterns is delivered as a shadow play. The rhythmic patterns can be manipulated by modifying the environment of the robot, through direct physical interaction with the robot, by rewiring the internal connectivity, and by adjusting internal parameters. The theory of embodied cognition provides the theoretical basis of this device. The core postulate of embodied cognition is that biological behavior can only be understood through an understanding of the real-time interactions of an organism's nervous system, the organism's body and the environment. One the one hand the device illustrates this theory because the patterns that are created equally depend on the real-time interactions of the electronics, the physical structure of the device and the environment. On the other hand the device presents a synthesis of these ideas and it is effectively possible to play with it at all the three levels, the electronics, the physical configuration of the robot and the environment.},

Our approach, called Rouages,is based on a mixed-reality display system and a 3D visualization application.It reveals the mechanisms of digital musical instruments by amplifyingmusicians' gestures with virtual extensions of the sensors, by representingthe sound components with 3D shapes and specific behaviors and by showing theimpact ofmusicians gestures on these components.

abstract = {Hyper-instruments extend traditional acoustic instruments with sensing technologies that capture digitally subtle and sophisticated aspects of human performance. They leverage the long training and skills of performers while simultaneously providing rich possibilities for digital control. Many existing hyper-instruments suffer from being one of a kind instruments that require invasive modifications to the underlying acoustic instrument. In this paper we focus on the pitched percussion family and describe a non-invasive sensing approach for extending them to hyper-instruments. Our primary concern is to retain the technical integrity of the acoustic instrument and sound production methods while being able to intuitively interface the computer. This is accomplished by utilizing the Kinect sensor to track the position of the mallets without any modification to the instrument which enables easy and cheap replication of the pro-posed hyper-instrument extensions. In addition we describe two approaches to higher-level gesture control that remove the need for additional control devices such as foot pedals and fader boxes that are frequently used in electro-acoustic performance. This gesture control integrates more organically with the natural flow of playing the instrument providing user selectable control over filter parameters, synthesis, sampling, sequencing, and improvisation using a commer-cially available low-cost sensing apparatus.},

abstract = {This paper presents the continuous work towards the development of an interfacefor music mixing targeted towards expert sound technicians and producers. Themixing interface uses a stage metaphor mapping scheme where audio channels arerepresented as digital widgets on a 2D surface. These can be controlled bymulti touch or by smart tangibles, which are tangible blocks with embeddedsensors. The smart tangibles developed for this interface are able to sense howthey are grasped by the user. The paper presents the design of the mixinginterface including the smart tangible as well as a preliminary user studyinvolving a hands-on focus group session where 5 different control technologiesare contrasted and discussed. Preliminary findings suggest that smart tangibleswere preferred, but that an optimal interface would include a combination oftouch, smart tangibles and an extra function control tangible for extending thefunctionality of the smart tangibles. Finally, the interface should incorporateboth an edit and mix mode - the latter displaying very limited visual feedbackin order to force users to focus their attention to listening instead of theinterface.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel collaborative environment (PESI) in whichperformers are not only free to move and interact with each other but wheretheir social interactions contribute to the sonic outcome. PESI system isdesigned for co-located collaboration and provides embodied and spatialopportunities for musical exploration. To evaluate PESI with skilled musicians,a user-test jam session was conducted. Musicians' comments indicate that thesystem facilitates group interaction finely to bring up further intentions tomusical ideas. Results from our user-test jam session indicate that, through some modificationof the 'in-space' response to the improvisation, and through more intuitiveinteractions with the 'on-body' mobile instruments, we could make thecollaborative music activity a more engaging and active experience. Despitebeing only user-tested once with musicians, the group interview has raisedfruitful discussions on the precise details of the system components.Furthermore, the paradigms of musical interaction and social actions in groupactivities need to be questioned when we seek design requirements for such acollaborative environment. We introduced a system that we believe can open upnew ways of musical exploration in group music activity with a number ofmusicians. The system brings up the affordances of accessible technologieswhile creating opportunities for novel design applications to be explored. Ourresearch proposes further development of the system, focusing on movementbehavior in long-term interaction between performers. We plan to implement thisversion and evaluate design and implementation with distinct skilled musicians.},

We explore three possible mechanisms how to get impact forces on mobile multi-touch devices: using built-in accelerometers, the pressure sensing capability of Android phones, and external force sensing resistors. We find that accelerometers are difficult to control for this purpose. Android's pressure sensing shows some promise, especially when combined with augmented playing technique. Force sensing resistors can offer good dynamic resolution but this technology is not currently offered in commodity devices and proper coupling of the sensor with the applied impact is difficult. },

During performance, the percussionist equally manipulates and expresses through two surfaces, an iPad displaying an interactive touch screen and a snare drum augmented with various foreign objects, including a contact microphone adhered to the drumhead's surface. A computer program created for this composition runs on a laptop computer in front of the percussionist. The software captures sound from the contact microphone and transforms this sound through audio signal processing controlled by the performer's gestures on the iPad. The computer screen displays an animated graphic score, as well as the current states of iPad controls and audio signal processing, for the performer. Many compositional and technological approaches used in this project pay tribute to composer John Cage, since the premiere performance of Engravings for Prepared Snare Drum, iPad, and Computer took place in 2012, the centennial celebration of Cage's birth year.},

As an alternative, an ecology of musical creation accounts for both a diversity of aesthetic goals and the complex interrelation of human and non-human agents. An ecological perspective on several approaches to musical creation with interactive technologies reveals an expanded, more inclusive view of artistic interaction that facilitates novel, compelling ways to use technology for music.

At the time,no usability studies seem to have been conducted on suchdevices, so one could question if they are really optimizedfor the task they are meant for.This paper proposes a new set of controls that might beused to simplify and/or improve the performance of audiomixing tasks, taking into account the spatial characteristicsof modern mixing technologies such as surround and 3Daudio and making use of multitouch interface technologies.A preliminary usability test has shown promising results.},

The algorithms within the toolbox have been designed to work with any N -dimensional signal and can be quickly trained with a small number of training examples. We also provide the motivation for the algorithms used for the recognition of musical gestures to achieve a low intra-personal generalisation error, as opposed to the inter-personal generalisation error that is more common in other areas of human-computer interaction.},

abstract = {What do new possibilities for music and art making look like in a world in which the biological and mechanical are increasingly entangled? Can a contrived environment envelope the senses to the point that one feel fully immersed in it? It was with these questions in mind that the interactive mechanical sound art installation endo/exo came into being. Through the use of networked technology the system becomes more like a self-aware organism, passing messages from node to node as cells communicate through chemical signals with their neighbors. In an artistic context, the communication network resembles, but differs from, other mechanical systems. Issues such as latency are often considered negative factors, yet they can contribute a touch of personality in this context. This paper is a reflection on these and other considerations gained from the experience of designing and constructing endo/exo as well as future implications for the Honeycomb platform as a tool for creating musical interactions within a new paradigm which allows for emergent behavior across vast physical spaces. The use of swarming and self-organization, as well as playful interaction, creates an ``aliveness" in the mechanism, and renders its exploration pleasurable, intriguing and uncanny.},

@inproceedings{nime2014:osarier,
abstract = {In the recent years many touch screen interfaces have been designed and used for musical control. When compared with their physical counterparts, current control paradigms employed in touch screen musical interfaces do not require the same level of physical labor and this negatively affects the user experience in terms of expressivity, engagement and enjoyment. This lack of physicality can be remedied by using interaction elements, which are designed for the exertion of the user. Employing intentionally difficult and inefficient interaction design can enhance the user experience by allowing greater bodily expression, kinesthetic feedback, more apparent skill acquisition, and performer satisfaction. Rub Synth is a touch screen musical instrument with an exertion interface. It was made for creating and testing exertion strategies that are possible by only using 2d touch coordinates as input and evaluating the outcomes of implementing intentional difficulty. This paper discusses the strategies that can be employed to model effort on touch screens, the benefits of having physical difficulty, Rub Synth's interaction design, and user experience results of using such an interface.},

The Live Cinema instrument is a cross between a musical instrument and a film editing tool, tailored for improvisational control as well as performance presence. Design specifications for the instrument evolved based on several types of observations including: our own performances in which we used a prototype based on available tools; an analysis of performative aspects of contemporary DJ equipment; and an evaluation of organizational aspects of several generations of film editing tools. Our instrument presents the performer with a large canvas where projected images can be grabbed and moved around with both hands simultaneously; the performer also has access to two video drums featuring haptic display to manipulate the shots and cut between streams. The paper ends with a discussion of issues related to the tensions between narrative structure and hands-on control, live and recorded arts and the scoring of improvised films. },

abstract = {Digitartic, a system for bi-manual gestural control of Vowel-Consonant-Vowelperformative singing synthesis is presented. This system is an extension of areal-time gesture-controlled vowel singing instrument developed in the Max/MSPlanguage. In addition to pitch, vowels and voice strength control, Digitarticis designed for gestural control of articulation parameters for a wide set onconsonant, including various places and manners of articulation. The phases ofarticulation between two phonemes are continuously controlled and can bedriven in real time without noticeable delay, at any stage of the syntheticphoneme production. Thus, as in natural singing, very accurate rhythmicpatterns are produced and adapted while playing with other musicians. Theinstrument features two (augmented) pen tablets for controlling voiceproduction: one is dealing with the glottal source and vowels, the second oneis dealing with consonant/vowel articulation. The results show very naturalconsonant and vowel synthesis. Virtual choral practice confirms theeffectiveness of Digitartic as an expressive musical instrument.},

abstract = {People with a physical handicap are often not able to engage and embrace the world of music on the same terms as normal functioning people. Musical instruments have been refined the last centuries which makes them highly specialized instruments that nearly all requires at least two functioning hands. In this study we try to enable people with hemiplegia to play a real electrical guitar by modifying it in a way that make people with hemiplegia able to actually play the guitar. We developed the guitar platform to utilize sensors to capture the rhythmic motion of alternative fully functioning limbs, such as a foot, knee or the head to activate a motorized fader moving a pick back and forth across the strings. The approach employs the flexibility of a programmable digital system which allows us to scale and map different ranges of data from various sensors to the motion of the actuator and thereby making it easier adapt to individual users. To validate and test the instrument platform we collaborated with the Helena Elsass Center during their 2013 Summer Camp to see if we actually succeeded in creating an electrical guitar that children with hemiplegia could actually play. The initial user studies showed that children with hemiplegia were able to play the actuated guitar by producing rhythmical movement across the strings that enables them to enter a world of music they so often see as closed.},

abstract = {This paper describes the conceptualization and development of an open source tool for controlling the sound of a saxophone via the gestures of its performer. The motivation behind this work is the need for easy access tools to explore, compose and perform electroacoustic music in Colombian music schools and conservatories. This work led to the adaptation of common hardware to be used as a sensor attached to an acoustic instrument and the development of software applications to record, visualize and map performers gesture data into signal processing parameters. The scope of this work suggested that focus was to be made on a specific instrument so the saxophone was chosen. Gestures were selected in an iterative process with the performer, although a more ambitious strategy to figure out main gestures of an instruments performance was first defined. Detailed gesture-to-sound processing mappings are exposed in the text. An electroacoustic musical piece was successfully rehearsed and recorded using the Gest-O system.},

abstract = {Many performers of novel musical instruments find it difficult to engage audiences beyond those in the field. Previousresearch points to a failure to balance complexity with usability, and a loss of transparency due to the detachmentof the controller and sound generator. The issue is oftenexacerbated by an audience's lack of prior exposure to theinstrument and its workings.However, we argue that there is a conflict underlyingmany novel musical instruments in that they are intendedto be both a tool for creative expression and a creative workof art in themselves, resulting in incompatible requirements.By considering the instrument, the composition and theperformance together as a whole with careful considerationof the rate of learning demanded of the audience, we propose that a lack of transparency can become an asset ratherthan a hindrance. Our approach calls for not only controllerand sound generator to be designed in sympathy with eachother, but composition, performance and physical form too.Identifying three design principles, we illustrate this approach with the Serendiptichord, a wearable instrument fordancers created by the ,

Initial formal analysis of this material sheds light on the fluidity of composer, performer and designer roles within the ensemble and shows how confluences of these roles constitute member's differing viewpoints. We go on to draw out a number of strands of interaction that highlight the essentially complex, socially constructed and value driven nature of the group's practice and conclude by reviewing the implications of these factors on the design of software tools for laptop ensembles.},

A performer can compose music by controlling varying cell patterns and sounds with visual and auditory fun. A performer assigns the elements of tone to two-dimensional cell patterns in the matrix of the Game of Life. Our system searches defined cell patterns in the varying matrix dynamically. If the patterns are matched, corresponding tones are generated. A performer can make cells in the matrix by moving in front of a camera and interactively influencing the generation of music. The progress of the Game of Life is controlled with a clock defined by the performer to configure the groove of the music. By running multiple matrices with different pattern mapping, clock timing, and instruments, we can perform an ensemble. The Life Game Orchestra is a fusion system of the design of a performer and the emergence of cellular automata as a complex system. },

Wealso present an augmented piano keyboard which reportsthe continuous position of every key. Time and spatial resolution are sufficient to capture detailed data about keypress, release, pretouch, aftertouch, and other extended gestures. The system, which is designed with cost and setupconstraints in mind, seeks to give pianists continuous control over the musical sound of their instrument.

As the intimacy between two people increases so does their ability to anticipate and predict the other's actions. We hypothesize that this intimacy between two people can be used as a basis for new controllers for musical expression. Looking at ways people communicate non-verbally, we are developing three new instruments based on different communication channels. The Tooka is a hollow tube with a pressure sensor and buttons for each player. Players place opposite ends in their mouths and modulate the pressure in the tube with their tongues and lungs, controlling sound. Coordinated button presses control the music as well. The Pushka, yet to be built, is a semirigid rod with strain gauges and position sensors to track the rod's position. Each player holds opposite ends of the rod and manipulates it together. Bend, end point position, velocity and acceleration and torque are mapped to musical parameters. The Pullka, yet to be built, is simply a string attached at both ends with two bridges. Tension is measured with strain gauges. Players manipulate the string tension at each end together to modulate sound. We are looking at different musical mappings appropriate for two players.},

Our target application is so-called motion controllers,i.e. systems that interpret hand motion for musical interaction. In earlierresearch we found effective methods to design nearly optimal filters forreal-time applications. However, to be able to design suitable filters for ourtarget application, it is necessary to establish the typical frequency contentof the motion capture data we want to filter. This will again allow us todetermine a reasonable cutoff frequency for the filters. We have thereforeconducted an experiment in which we recorded the hand motion of 20 subjects.The frequency spectra of these data together with a method similar to theresidual analysis method were then used to determine reasonable cutofffrequencies. Based on this experiment, we propose three cutoff frequencies fordifferent scenarios and filtering needs: 5, 10 and 15 Hz, which corresponds toheavy, medium and light filtering respectively. Finally, we propose a range ofreal-time filters applicable to motion controllers. In particular, low-passfilters and low-pass differentiators of degrees one and two, which in ourexperience are the most useful filters for our target application.},

abstract = {As a 2010 Artist in Residence in Musical Research at IRCAM, Mari Kimura used the Augmented Violin to develop new compositional approaches, and new ways of creating interactive performances [1]. She contributed her empirical and historical knowledge of violin bowing technique, working with the Real Time Musical Interactions Team at IRCAM. Thanks to this residency, her ongoing long-distance collaboration with the team since 2007 dramatically accelerated, and led to solving several compositional and calibration issues of the Gesture Follower (GF) [2]. Kimura was also the first artist to develop projects between the two teams at IRCAM, using OMAX (Musical Representation Team) with GF. In the past year, the performance with Augmented Violin has been expanded in larger scale interactive audio/visual projects as well. In this paper, we report on the various techniques developed for the Augmented Violin and compositions by Kimura using them, offering specific examples and scores.},

abstract = {This paper presents an implementation of a near real-time timbre morphing signal processing system, designed to facilitate an element of `liveness' and unpredictability in a musical installation. The timbre morpher is a hybrid analysis and synthesis technique based on Spectral Modeling Synthesis (an additive and subtractive modeling technique). The musical installation forms an interactive soundtrack in response to the series of Rosso Luana marble sculptures Shapes in the Clouds, I, II, III, IV {\&} V by artist Peter Randall-Page, exhibited at the Peninsula Arts Gallery in Devon, UK, from 1 February to 29 March 2014. The timbre morphing system is used to transform live input captured at each sculpture with a discrete microphone array, by morphing towards noisy source signals that have been associated with each sculpture as part of a pre-determined musical structure. The resulting morphed audio is then fed-back to the gallery via a five-channel speaker array. Visitors are encouraged to walk freely through the installation and interact with the sound world, creating unique audio morphs based on their own movements, voices, and incidental sounds.},

We also discussmethodologies for composing with this system, and suggesttwo approaches. The first is to make desirable keys (or otherkeys) hot. The second one uses chroma-profile, that is, a radarchart representation of the frequency of pitch notations in the-piece. By making keys of the same chroma hot in reverse proportion to the value of the chroma-profile, it is possible to-constrain the performer's improvisation and to bring the tonality space close to a certain piece.},

Following this we describe the development of a specific sonic character, mapping approach and performance. In both these parts an explicit consideration of the type of movement we would like the device to engender in performance drove the design choices. By considering these two parts separately we draw attention to two different levels at which movement might be considered in the design of DMIs; at a general level of ranges of movement in the creation of the controller and a more specific, but still quite open, level in the creation of the final instrument and a particular performance. In light of the results of this process the limitations of existing representations of movement within the DMI design discourse is discussed. Further, the utility of a movement focused design approach is discussed.},

Our approach, called Rouages,is based on a mixed-reality display system and a 3D visualization application.It reveals the mechanisms of digital musical instruments by amplifyingmusicians' gestures with virtual extensions of the sensors, by representingthe sound components with 3D shapes and specific behaviors and by showing theimpact ofmusicians gestures on these components. We believe that Rouages opens up newperspectives to help instrument makers and musicians improve audienceexperience with their digital musical instruments.},

abstract = {Tangible Acoustic Interfaces (TAI) rely on various acousticsensing technologies, such as sound source location and acoustic imaging, to detect the position of contact of users interacting with the surface of solid materials. With their ability to transform almost any physical objects, flat or curved surfaces and walls into interactive interfaces, acoustic sensing technologies show a promising way to bring the sense of touch into the realm of computer interaction. Because music making has been closely related to this sense during centuries, an application of particular interest is the use of TAI's for the design of new musical instruments that matches the physicality and expressiveness of classical instruments. This paper gives an overview of the various acoustic-sensing technologies involved in the realisation of TAI's and develops on the motivation underlying their use for the design of new musical instruments. },

The Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework and Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory are combined to demonstrate how non-realtime, notation-mediated interaction can support focused, immersive, energetic, and intrinsically- rewarding musical experiences, and to what extent they are supported in the interfaces of music production software. Users are shown to maintain liveness through a rapid, iterative edit- audition cycle that integrates audio and visual feedback.},

Techniques for accomplishing such mappings and enabling feature-based synthesis to be performed in real time are discussed.

This paper introduces an interactive system to control music playback for dance performances based on the respiration pattern of the dancer. A wireless wearable sensor device detects the dancer's respiration, which is then utilized to modify the dynamic of music. Two different respiration- dynamic mappings were designed and evaluated through public performances and private tests by professional choreographers. Results from this research suggest a new conceptual approach to musical applications of respiration based on the technical characteristics of music and dance.},

The laser beams, which are made visible by a thin layer of theatrical mist, provide visual feedback and guidance to the performer to alleviate the difficulties of using a non-contact interface as well as adding an interesting component for the audience to observe. The system uses capacitive sensing to detect the proximity of the player's hands; this distance is mapped to pitch, volume, or other continuous effect. The laser guide positions are calibrated before play with position controlled servo motors interfaced to a main controller board; the location of each beam corresponds to the position where the performer should move his or her hand to achieve a pre-specified pitch and/or effect. The optical system senses the distance of the player's hands from the source of each laser beam, providing an additional dimension of musical control. },

abstract = {Development of new musical interfaces often requires experimentation with the mapping of available controller inputs to output parameters. Useful mappings for a particular application may be complex in nature, with one or more inputs being linked to one or more outputs. Existing development environments are commonly used to program such mappings, while code libraries provide powerful data-stream manipulation. However, room exists for a standalone application with a simpler graphical user interface for dynamically patching between inputs and outputs. This paper presents an early prototype version of a software tool that allows the user to route control signals in real time, using various messaging formats. It is cross-platform and runs as a standalone application in desktop and Android OS versions. The latter allows the users of mobile devices to experiment with mapping signals to and from physical computing components using the inbuilt multi-touch screen. Potential uses therefore include real-time mapping during performance in a more expressive manner than facilitated by existing tools.},

Participants were asked to improvise music on "SoundXY4: The Art of Noise", a tabletop system that includes sound samples inspired by Russolo's taxonomy of noises.

abstract = {The maturation process of the NIME field has brought a growing interest in teaching the design and implementa- tion of Digital Music Instruments (DMI) as well as in find- ing objective evaluation methods to assess the suitability of these outcomes. In this paper we propose a methodology for teaching NIME design and a set of tools meant to inform the design process. This approach has been applied in a master course focused on the exploration of expressiveness and on the role of the mapping component in the NIME cre- ation chain, through hands-on and self-reflective approach based on a restrictive setup consisting of smart-phones and the Pd programming language. Working Groups were formed, and a 2-step DMI design process was applied, including 2 performance stages. The evaluation tools assessed both System and Performance as- pects of each project, according to Listeners' impressions after each performance. Listeners' previous music knowl- edge was also considered. Through this methodology, stu- dents with different backgrounds were able to effectively engage in the NIME design processes, developing working DMI prototypes according to the demanded requirements; the assessment tools proved to be consistent for evaluating NIMEs systems and performances, and the fact of inform- ing the design processes with the outcome of the evaluation, showed a traceable progress in the students outcomes.},

In this context, the focus ofthis paper is the development of a model that can represent a relationshipbetween timbre and an expected emotional affect . The results of the evaluationof the presented model are encouraging which supports its use in steering oraugmenting the control of the audio synthesis.

abstract = {Sketching is a natural way for one person to convey their thoughts and intentions to another. With the recent rise of tablet-based computing, the use of sketching as a control and interaction paradigm is one that deserves exploration. In this paper we present an interactive sketch-based music composition and performance system called Drawchestra. The aim of the system is to give users an intuitive way to convey their musical ideas to a computer system with the minimum of technical training thus enabling them to focus on the creative tasks of composition and performance. The system provides the user with a canvas upon which they may create their own instruments by sketching shapes on the tablet screen. The system recognises a certain set of shapes which it treats as virtual instruments or effects. Once recognised, these virtual instruments can then be play- ed by the user in real time. The size of a sketched in- strument shape is used to control certain parameters of the sound so the user can build complex orchestras contain- ing many different shapes of different sizes. The sketched shapes may also be moved and resized as desired making it possible to customise and edit the virtual orchestra as the user goes along. The system has been implemented in Python and user tests conducted using an iPad as the control surface. We report the results of the user study at the end of the paper before briefly discussing the outcome and outlining the next steps for the system design.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of a new method for approaching beat sequencing. As we have come to know them drum machines provide means to loop rhythmic patterns over a certain interval. Usually with the option to specify different beat divisions. What I developed and propose for consideration is a rethinking of the traditional drum machine confines. The Sinkapater is an untethered beat sequencer in that the beat division, and the loop length can be arbitrarily modified for each track. The result is the capability to create complex syncopated patterns which evolve over time as different tracks follow their own loop rate. To keep cohesion all channels can be locked to a master channel forcing a loop to be an integer number of "Master Beats". Further a visualization mode enables exploring the patterns in another new way. Using synchronized OpenGL a 3-Dimensional environment visualizes the beats as droplets falling from faucets of varying heights determined by the loop length. Waves form in the bottom as beats splash into the virtual "sink". By combining compelling visuals and a new approach to sequencing a new way of exploring beats and experiencing music has been created.},

PESI system isdesigned for co-located collaboration and provides embodied and spatialopportunities for musical exploration. To evaluate PESI with skilled musicians,a user-test jam session was conducted. Musicians' comments indicate that thesystem facilitates group interaction finely to bring up further intentions tomusical ideas. Results from our user-test jam session indicate that, through some modificationof the 'in-space' response to the improvisation, and through more intuitiveinteractions with the 'on-body' mobile instruments, we could make thecollaborative music activity a more engaging and active experience. Despitebeing only user-tested once with musicians, the group interview has raisedfruitful discussions on the precise details of the system components.Furthermore, the paradigms of musical interaction and social actions in groupactivities need to be questioned when we seek design requirements for such acollaborative environment. We introduced a system that we believe can open upnew ways of musical exploration in group music activity with a number ofmusicians. The system brings up the affordances of accessible technologieswhile creating opportunities for novel design applications to be explored. Ourresearch proposes further development of the system, focusing on movementbehavior in long-term interaction between performers. We plan to implement thisversion and evaluate design and implementation with distinct skilled musicians.},

Links are suggested between the sonic affordances of each instru- ment and the dynamical mechanisms embedded in them. This is discussed in the context of contemporary, material- oriented approaches to composition and particularly to free improvisation where elements such as unpredictability and instability are often of interest, and the process of explo- ration and discovery is an important part of the practice. Links are also made with the use of dynamical interactions in computer games to produce situations in which slight variations in the timing and ordering of inputs can lead to very different outcomes, encouraging similarly explorative approaches.},

Our implementation uses the Kinect depth sensor to track body motion in space, which is used as input data. During an initial learning phase, the system is taught a set of reference gestures, or templates. During performance, the live gesture is classified in real-time, and variations with respect to the recognized template are computed. These values can then be mapped to audio processing parameters, to control digital effects which are applied to the acoustic output of the piano in real-time. We discuss initial tests using PiaF with a pianist, as well as potential applications beyond live performance, including pedagogy and embodiment of recorded performance.},

The trajectory ofcircular motion drawn by the performance and the momentum of the mPoiinstrument are converted to the energetic and vibrant sound, which makesspiritual and meditative soundscape that opens everyone up the aura and clearsthe thought forms away. The mPoi project and its concepts will be introducedfirst and then its interaction with a performer will be discussed.The mPoi project seeks to develop a prototype for a set of mobile musicalinstrument based on electronic motion sensors and circuit boards. Thistechnology is installed in egg-shaped structure and allows communicationbetween a performer and the mPoi instrument. The principal motivation for themPoi project has been a desire to develop an extensible interface that willsupport the Poi performance, which is a style of performance art originatedwith the Maori people of New Zealand involving swinging tethered weightsthrough a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns. As an extension of the body and the expansion of the movement, the mPoiutilizes the creative performance of Poi to make spatial and spiritual soundand music. The aims of the mPoi project are:to create a prototype of mPoi instrument that includes circuit board thatconnects the instrument to a sensor.to develop a software, which includes programming of the circuit board and forthe sound generation.to make a new artistic expression to refine the captured sound into artisticmusical notes. The creative part of the project is to design a unique method to translate theperformer's gesture into sound. A unique algorithm was developed to extractfeatures of the swing motion and translate them into various patterns of sound.},

In this context, the focus ofthis paper is the development of a model that can represent a relationshipbetween timbre and an expected emotional affect . The results of the evaluationof the presented model are encouraging which supports its use in steering oraugmenting the control of the audio synthesis.

With its limited amount of control parameters, this was a challenge. Second, through this instrument we wanted to provide an alternative to the view that you become a hero by perfect imitation of your idols. Instead, play yourself. You are the hero. In this paper, we describe the design of the instrument, including its novel mapping approach based on switched timbre vectors scaled by accellerometer data, unconventional sound engines and the sound and mapping editing features, including manual editing of individual vectors. The instrument is evaluated through its practical applications during the whole project, with workshops with teenagers, a set of state-funded commissions from professional composers, and the development of considerable skill by the key performers. We have also submitted a performance proposal for this project.},

The online open source development community has embraced the Wii remote, integrating the inexpensive technology into numerous applications. Some of the more interesting applications demonstrate how the remote hardware can be leveraged for nonstandard uses. In this paper we describe a new way of interacting with the Wii remote and sensor bar to produce music. The Wiiolin is a virtual instrument which can mimic a violin or cello. Sensor bar motion relative to the Wii remote and button presses are analyzed in real-time to generate notes. Our design is novel in that it involves the remote's infrared camera and sensor bar as an integral part of music production, allowing users to change notes by simply altering the angle of their wrist, and henceforth, bow. The Wiiolin introduces a more realistic way of instrument interaction than other attempts that rely on button presses and accelerometer data alone. },

In this paper, we present a new time-based paradigm for programming controllers with ChucK. In addition to real-time control over sound synthesis, we show how features such as dynamic patching, on-the-fly controller mapping, multiple control rates, and precisely-timed recording and playback of sensors can be employed under the ChucK programming model. Using this framework, composers, programmers, and performers can quickly write (and read/debug) complex controller/synthesis programs, and experiment with controller mapping on-the-fly.},

abstract = {"We discuss how to model ""gestures"" in music performance with statisticallatent-states models. A music performance can be described with compositionaland expressive properties varying over time. In those property changes we oftenobserve particular patterns, and such a pattern can be understood as a""gesture"", since it serves as a medium transferring specific emotions. Assuminga finite number of latent states on each property value changes, we candescribe those gestures with statistical latent-states models, and train themby unsupervised learning algorithms. In addition, model entropy provides us ameasure for different effects of each properties on the gesture implementation.Test result on some of real performances indicates that the trained modelscould capture the structure of gestures observed in the given performances, anddetect their boundaries. The entropy-based measure was informative tounderstand the effectiveness of each property on the gesture implementation.Test result on large corpora indicates that our model has potentials for afurther model improvement."},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of engaging the audience with new musical instruments in live performance context. We introduce design concerns that we consider influential to enhance the communication flow between the audience and the performer. We also propose and put in practice a design approach that considers the use of performance space as a way to engage with the audience. A collaborative project, Sound Gloves, presented here exemplifies such a concept by dissolving the space between performers and audience. Our approach resulted in a continuous interaction between audience and performers, in which the social dynamics was changed in a positive way in a live performance context of NIMEs. Such an approach, we argue, may be considered as one way to further engage and interact with the audience.},

Mobile instruments are extended by means of relational descriptors democratically controlled by the group and mapped to sound parameters. A qualitative evaluation approach is described and a user test with participants playing in groups of three conducted. The results of the analysis show core- categories such as familiarity with instrument and situation, shift of focus in activity, family of interactions and different categories of the experience emerging from the interviews. Our evaluation shows the suitability of our approach but also the need for iterating on our design on the basis of the perspectives brought forth by the users. This latter observation confirms the importance of conducting a thorough interview session followed by data analysis on the line of grounded theory.},

It is hopedthat the techniques described in this paper afford performers and composers anenhanced level of creative expression in the diffusion performance practice.This paper introduces and evaluates tactile.space, a multi-touch performanceinterface for diffusion built on the BrickTable. It describes how tactile.spaceimplements Vector Base Amplitude Panning to achieve real- time sourcepositioning. The final section of this paper presents the findings of a userstudy that was conducted by those who performed with the interface, evaluatingthe interface as a performance tool with a focus on the increased creativeexpression the interface affords, and directly comparing it to the traditionaldiffusion user interface.},

However, if a user has a general idea of the sound they are trying to program, they may be able to imitate it with their voice. This paper presents SynthAssist, a system for interactively searching the synthesis space of an audio synthesizer. In this work, we present how to use the system for querying a database of audio synthesizer patches (i.e. settings/parameters) by vocal imitation and user feedback. To account for the limitations of the human voice, it uses both absolute and relative time series representations of features and relevance feedback on both the feature weights and time series to refine the query. The method presented in this paper can be used to search through large databases of previously existing ``factory presets" or program a synthesizer using the data-driven approach to automatic synthesizer programming.},

abstract = {In this paper an emotionally justified approach for controlling sound with physiology is presented. Measurements of listeners' physiology, while they are listening to recorded music of their own choosing, are used to create a regression model that predicts features extracted from music with the help of the listeners' physiological response patterns. This information can be used as a control signal to drive musical composition and synthesis of new sounds - an approach involving concatenative sound synthesis is suggested. An evaluation study was conducted to test the feasibility of the model. A multiple linear regression model and an artificial neural network model were evaluated against a constant regressor, or dummy model. The dummy model outperformed the other models in prediction accuracy, but the artificial neural network model achieved significant correlations between predictions and target values for many acoustic features.},

abstract = {The use of physiological signals in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is becoming popular and widespread, mostlydue to sensors miniaturization and advances in real-timeprocessing. However, most of the studies that use physiologybased interaction focus on single-user paradigms, and itsusage in collaborative scenarios is still in its beginning. Inthis paper we explore how interactive sonification of brainand heart signals, and its representation through physicalobjects (physiopucks) in a tabletop interface may enhancemotivational and controlling aspects of music collaboration.A multimodal system is presented, based on an electrophysiology sensor system and the Reactable, a musical tabletop interface. Performance and motivation variables wereassessed in an experiment involving a test "Physio" group(N=22) and a control "Placebo" group (N=10). Pairs ofparticipants used two methods for sound creation: implicitinteraction through physiological signals, and explicit interaction by means of gestural manipulation. The resultsshowed that pairs in the Physio Group declared less difficulty, higher confidence and more symmetric control thanthe Placebo Group, where no real-time sonification was provided as subjects were using pre-recorded physiological signal being unaware of it. These results support the feasibilityof introducing physiology-based interaction in multimodalinterfaces for collaborative music generation.},

abstract = {This paper explores the challenge of achieving nuanced control and physical engagement with gestural interfaces in performance. Performances with a prototype gestural performance system, Gestate, provide the basis for insights into the application of gestural systems in live contexts. These reflections stem from a performer's perspective, outlining the experience of prototyping and performing with augmented instruments that extend vocal or instrumental technique through ancillary gestures. Successful implementation of rapidly evolving gestural technologies in real-time performance calls for new approaches to performing and musicianship, centred around a growing understanding of the body's physical and creative potential. For musicians hoping to incorporate gestural control seamlessly into their performance practice a balance of technical mastery and kinaesthetic awareness is needed to adapt existing systems to their own purposes. Within non-tactile systems, visual feedback mechanisms can support this process by providing explicit visual cues that compensate for the absence of haptic or tangible feedback. Experience gained through prototyping and performance can yield a deeper understanding of the broader nature of gestural control and the way in which performers inhabit their own bodies.},

abstract = {For the electric guitar, which takes a large proportion in modern pop music, effects unit (or effector) is no longer optional. Many guitarists already `play' their effects with their instrument. However, it is not easy to control these effects during the play, so lots of new controllers and interfaces have been devised; one example is a pedal type effects that helps players to control effects with a foot while their hands are busy. Some players put a controller on their guitars. However, our instruments are so precious to drill a hole, and the stage is too big for the player who is just kneeling behind the pedals and turning the knobs. In this paper, we designed a new control system for electric guitar and bass. This paper is about a gesture-based sound control system that controls the electric guitar effects (like delay time, reverberation or pitch) with the player's hand gesture. This system utilizes TAPIR signal to trace player's hand motion. TAPIR signal is an acoustic signal that can rarely be received by most people, because its frequency exists between 18 kHz to 22 kHz [TAPIR article]. This system consists of a signal generator, an electric guitar and a sound processor. From the generator that is attached on the player's hand, the TAPIR signal transfers to the magnetic pickup equipped on the electric guitar. Player's gesture is captured as a Doppler shift and the processor calculates the value as the sound effect parameter. In this paper, we focused on the demonstration of the signal transfer on aforementioned system.},

@inproceedings{nime2014:pmathews,
abstract = {Networked musical performance - using networks of computers for live performance of electronic music - has evolved over a number of decades but has tended to rely upon customized and highly specialized software designed specifically for particular artistic goals. This paper presents Tangle, a flexible software framework designed to provide a basis for performance on any number of distinct instruments. The network includes features to simplify the control of robotic instruments, such as automated latency compensation and self-testing, while being simple to extend in order to implement device-specific logic and failsafes. Tangle has been tested on two diverse systems incorporating a number of unique and complex mechatronic instruments.},

@inproceedings{nime2014:cnash,
abstract = {This paper explores the concept of end-user programming languages in music composition, and introduces the Manhattan system, which integrates formulas with a grid-based style of music sequencer. Following the paradigm of spreadsheets, an established model of end-user programming, Manhattan is designed to bridge the gap between traditional music editing methods (such as MIDI sequencing and typesetting) and generative and algorithmic music -- seeking both to reduce the learning threshold of programming and support flexible integration of static and dynamic musical elements in a single work. Interaction draws on rudimentary knowledge of mathematics and spreadsheets to augment the sequencer notation with programming concepts such as expressions, built-in functions, variables, pointers and arrays, iteration (for loops), branching (goto), and conditional statements (if-then-else). In contrast to other programming tools, formulas emphasise the visibility of musical data (e.g. notes), rather than code, but also allow composers to interact with notated music from a more abstract perspective of musical processes. To illustrate the function and use cases of the system, several examples of traditional and generative music are provided, the latter drawing on minimalism (process-based music) as an accessible introduction to algorithmic composition. Throughout, the system and approach are evaluated using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework, together with early feedback for use by artists.},

@inproceedings{Levinson:2012,
abstract = {TedStick is a new wireless musical instrument that processes acoustic sounds resonating within its wooden body and ma- nipulates them via gestural movements. The sounds are transduced by a piezoelectric sensor inside the wooden body, so any tactile contact with TedStick is transmitted as audio and further processed by a computer. The main method for performing with TedStick focuses on extracting diverse sounds from within the resonant properties of TedStick it- self. This is done by holding TedStick in one hand and a standard drumstick in the opposite hand while tapping, rubbing, or scraping the two against each other. Gestural movements of TedStick are then mapped to parameters for several sound effects including pitch shift, delay, reverb and low/high pass filters. Using this technique the hand holding the drumstick can control the acoustic sounds/interaction between the sticks while the hand holding TedStick can fo- cus purely on controlling the sound manipulation and effects parameters.},

However, sound synthesis on thesesystems is often limited to sample-based synthesizers, whichlimits their expressive capabilities. Source-filter models areadept for such interfaces since they provide flexible, algorithmic sound synthesis, especially in the case of the guitar.In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for modeling guitar excitation signals using principal componentsderived from a corpus of excitation signals. Using thesecomponents as features, we apply nonlinear principal components analysis to derive a feature space that describesthe expressive attributes characteristic to our corpus. Finally, we propose using the reduced dimensionality space asa control interface for an expressive guitar synthesizer.},
