abstract = {One embodiment of a surface force distribution sensor includes an elastic dielectric (108) sandwiched by a ?rst plurality of compliant, conductive carrier elements (110) and a second plurality of conductive pickup elements (106), as Well as a system for frequency-domain demultiplexing including at least a microprocessor (209). A plurality of sig nals is generated, each of Which has a different fundamental frequency and is connected to a different carrier element. The pickup and Carrier elements are arranged SO that each Pickup element overlaps one or more carrier elements. When forces are applied to a nonconductive compliant layer (112), the distance betWeen one or more carrier elements and one or more pickup elements decreases at their points of overlap, increasing the amplitude of carrier signals capacitively trans mitted to the pickup elements. The microprocessor demulti plexes the signals received from the pickup elements to deter mine the amplitude of each carrier signal received, and thereby the applied force, at each point of overlap on the surface of the compliant layer. Other embodiments are described and shoWn.},

abstract = {Transducer materials convert one form of energy into another, and are widely used in sensing applications. The tremendous growth in the use of microprocessors has propelled the demand for sensors in diverse applications. Today, PIEZOELECTRIC POLYMER SENSORS are among the fastest growing of the technologies within the {\$}18 billion worldwide sensor market. Like any new technology, there have been an extraordinary number of applications where "PIEZO FILM" has been considered for the sensor solution. In the 20 years since the discovery of piezoelectric polymer, the technology has matured, practical applications have emerged from a long list of possibilities, and the rate of commercialization of the technology is accelerating. These documents provide an overview of piezoelectric polymer technology and nomenclature, its properties, and sensor design considerations. It also explores a range of sensor applications that have been successfully developed in recent years. Solving unique sensor problems is a particular strength of our group of applications engineers. We welcome the opportunity to provide assistance to you during your evaluation of piezo film sensors for your design.},
