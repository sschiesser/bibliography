abstract = {Force-feedback and physical modeling technologies now allow to achieve the same kind of relation with virtual instruments as with acoustic instruments, but the design of such elaborate models needs guidelines based on the study of the human sensory-motor system and behaviour. This article presents a qualitative study of a simulated instrumental interaction in the case of the virtual bowed string, using both waveguide and mass-interaction models. Subjects were invited to explore the possibilities of the simulations and to express themselves verbally at the same time, allowing us to identify key qualities of the proposed systems that determine the construction of an intimate and rich relationship with the users.},

abstract = {Stability and performance during rhythmic motor behaviors such as locomotion are critical for survival across taxa: falling down would bode well for neither cheetah nor gazelle. Little is known about how haptic feedback, particularly during discrete events such as the heel-strike event during walking, enhances rhythmic behavior. To determine the effect of haptic cues on rhythmic motor performance, we investigated a virtual paddle juggling behavior, analogous to bouncing a table tennis ball on a paddle. Here, we show that a force impulse to the hand at the moment of ball-paddle collision categorically improves performance over visual feedback alone, not by regulating the rate of convergence to steady state (e.g., via higher gain feedback or modifying the steady-state hand motion), but rather by reducing cycle-to-cycle variability. This suggests that the timing and state cues afforded by haptic feedback decrease the nervous system's uncertainty of the state of the ball to enable more accurate control but that the feedback gain itself is unaltered. This decrease in variability leads to a substantial increase in the mean first passage time, a measure of the long-term metastability of a stochastic dynamical system. Rhythmic tasks such as locomotion and juggling involve intermittent contact with the environment (i.e., hybrid transitions), and the timing of such transitions is generally easy to sense via haptic feedback. This timing information may improve metastability, equating to less frequent falls or other failures depending on the task.},

The present study tested the hypothesis that leveraging off the musician's unconscious llse of combined auditory and haptic cnes by adding haptic feedback to computer-based musical instruments would improve the "playability" of these instruments. Twenty experienced musicians played a series of short melodies on an unfamiliar computer-based lllusical instrument. The instrument's controller was capable of producing force feedback making it possible to systematically vary the instrument's feel. Results indicate that the presence of haptic feedback improved playing accuracy by approxilllately 23 percent. Moreover haptic feedback which was correlated with changes in the lllusical parameter being controlled produced greater playing accuracy than uncorrelated haptic feedback.},

abstract = {Evaluation has been suggested to be one of the main trends in current NIME research. However, the meaning of the term for the community may not be as clear as it seems. In order to explore this issue, we have analyzed all papers and posters published in the proceedings of the NIME conference from 2012 to 2014. For each publication that explicitly mentioned the term “evaluation”, we looked for: a) What targets and stakeholders were considered? b) What goals were set? c) What criteria were used? d) What methods were used? e) How long did the evaluation last? Results show different understandings of evaluation, with little con- sistency regarding the usage of the word. Surprisingly in some cases, not even basic information such as goal, criteria and methods were provided. In this paper, we attempt to provide an idea of what “evaluation” means for the NIME community, pushing the discussion towards how could we make a better use of evaluation on NIME design and what criteria should be used regarding each goal.},

abstract = {We argue that audio-tactile interactions during vibrotactile processing provide a promising, albeit largely neglected, benchmark for the systematic study multisensory integration. This article reviews and discusses current evidence for multisensory contributions to the perception of vibratory events, and proposes a framework to address a number of relevant questions. First, we highlight some of the features that characterize the senses of hearing and touch in terms of vibratory information processing, and which allow for potential cross-modal interactions at multiple levels along the functional architecture of the sensory systems. Second, we briefly review empirical evidence for interactions between hearing and touch in the domain of vibroactile perception and related stimulus properties, covering behavioural, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies in humans and animals. Third, we discuss the vibrotactile discrimination task, which has been successfully applied in the study of perception and decision processes in psychophysical and physiological research. We argue that this approach, complemented with computational modeling using biophysically realistic neural networks, may be a convenient framework to address auditory contributions to vibrotactile processing in the somatosensory system. Finally, we comment on a series of particular issues which are relevant in multisensory research and potentially addressable within the proposed framework.},

abstract = {The overall goal of the research presented here is to better understand how players evaluate violins within the wider context of finding relationships between measurable vibrational properties of instruments and their perceived qualities. In this study, the reliability of skilled musicians to evaluate the qualities of a violin was examined. In a first experiment, violinists were allowed to freely play a set of different violins and were then asked to rank the instruments by preference. Results showed that players were self-consistent, but a large amount of inter-individual variability was present. A second experiment was then conducted to investigate the origin of inter-individual differences in the preference for violins and to measure the extent to which different attributes of the instrument influence preference. Again, results showed large inter-individual variations in the preference for violins, as well as in assessing various characteristics of the instruments. Despite the significant lack of agreement in preference and the variability in how different criteria are evaluated between individuals, violin players tend to agree on the relevance of sound "richness" and, to a lesser extent, "dynamic range" for determining preference.},

@article{Goebl2014,
abstract = {Both timbre and dynamics of isolated piano tones are determined exclusively by the speed with which the hammer hits the strings. This physical view has been challenged by pianists who emphasize the importance of the way the keyboard is touched. This article presents empirical evidence from two perception experiments showing that touch-dependent sound components make sounds with identical hammer velocities but produced with different touch forms clearly distinguishable. The first experiment focused on finger-key sounds: musicians could identify pressed and struck touches. When the finger-key sounds were removed from the sounds, the effect vanished, suggesting that these sounds were the primary identification cue. The second experiment looked at key-keyframe sounds that occur when the key reaches key-bottom. Key-bottom impact was identified from key motion measured by a computer-controlled piano. Musicians were able to discriminate between piano tones that contain a key-bottom sound from those that do not. However, this effect might be attributable to sounds associated with the mechanical components of the piano action. In addition to the demonstrated acoustical effects of different touch forms, visual and tactile modalities may play important roles during piano performance that influence the production and perception of musical expression on the piano.},

abstract = {Object manipulation produces characteristic sounds and causes specific haptic sensations that facilitate the recognition of the manipulated object. To identify the neural correlates of audio-haptic binding of object features, healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they matched a target object to a sample object within and across audition and touch. By introducing a delay between the presentation of sample and target stimuli, it was possible to dissociate haptic-to-auditory and auditory-to-haptic matching. We hypothesized that only semantically coherent auditory and haptic object features activate cortical regions that host unified conceptual object representations. The left fusiform gyrus (FG) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) showed increased activation during crossmodal matching of semantically congruent but not incongruent object stimuli. In the FG, this effect was found for haptic-to-auditory and auditory-to-haptic matching, whereas the pSTS only displayed a crossmodal matching effect for congruent auditory targets. Auditory and somatosensory association cortices showed increased activity during crossmodal object matching which was, however, independent of semantic congruency. Together, the results show multisensory interactions at different hierarchical stages of auditory and haptic object processing. Object-specific crossmodal interactions culminate in the left FG, which may provide a higher order convergence zone for conceptual object knowledge.},

abstract = {Our body is made of flesh and bones. We know it, and in our daily lives all the senses constantly provide converging information about this simple, factual truth. But is this always the case? Here we report a surprising bodily illusion demonstrating that humans rapidly update their assumptions about the material qualities of their body, based on their recent multisensory perceptual experience. To induce a misperception of the material properties of the hand, we repeatedly gently hit participants' hand with a small hammer, while progressively replacing the natural sound of the hammer against the skin with the sound of a hammer hitting a piece of marble. After five minutes, the hand started feeling stiffer, heavier, harder, less sensitive, unnatural, and showed enhanced Galvanic skin response (GSR) to threatening stimuli. Notably, such a change in skin conductivity positively correlated with changes in perceived hand stiffness. Conversely, when hammer hits and impact sounds were temporally uncorrelated, participants did not spontaneously report any changes in the perceived properties of the hand, nor did they show any modulation in GSR. In two further experiments, we ruled out that mere audio-tactile synchrony is the causal factor triggering the illusion, further demonstrating the key role of material information conveyed by impact sounds in modulating the perceived material properties of the hand. This novel bodily illusion, the 'Marble-Hand Illusion', demonstrates that the perceived material of our body, surely the most stable attribute of our bodily self, can be quickly updated through multisensory integration.},

abstract = {In musical performance, bodily gestures play an important role in communicating expressive intentions to audiences. Although previous studies have demonstrated that visual information can have an effect on the perceived expressivity of musical performances, the investigation of audiovisual interactions has been held back by the technical difficulties associated with the generation of controlled, mismatching stimuli.With the present study, we aimed to address this issue by utilizing a novel method in order to generate controlled, balanced stimuli that comprised both matching and mismatching bimodal combinations of different expressive intentions. The aim of Experiment 1 was to investigate the relative contributions of auditory and visual kinematic cues in the perceived expressivity of piano performances, and in Experiment 2 we explored possible crossmodal interactions in the perception of auditory and visual expressivity. The results revealed that although both auditory and visual kinematic cues contribute significantly to the perception of overall expressivity, the effect of visual kinematic cues appears to be somewhat stronger. These results also provide preliminary evidence of crossmodal interactions in the perception of auditory and visual expressivity. In certain performance conditions, visual cues had an effect on the ratings of auditory expressivity, and auditory cues had a small effect on the ratings of visual expressivity.},

abstract = {To form a coherent percept of the environment, our brain combines information from different senses. Such multisensory integration occurs in higher association cortices; but supposedly, it also occurs in early sensory areas. Confirming the latter hypothesis, we unequivocally demonstrate supra-additive integration of touch and sound stimulation at the second stage of the auditory cortex. Using high-resolution fMRI of the macaque monkey, we quantified the integration of auditory broad-band noise and tactile stimulation of hand and foot in anaesthetized animals. Integration was found posterior to and along the lateral side of the primary auditory cortex in the caudal auditory belt. Integration was stronger for temporally coincident stimuli and obeyed the principle of inverse effectiveness: greater enhancement for less effective stimuli. These findings demonstrates that multisensory integration occurs early and close to primary sensory areas and--because it occurs in anaesthetized animals--suggests that this integration is mediated by preattentive bottom-up mechanisms.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to shed light on cortical audiotactile integration and sensory substitution mechanisms, thought to serve as a basis for the use of a sensor glove in the preservation of the cortical map of the hand after peripheral nerve injuries. Fourteen subjects were selected and randomly assigned either to a training group, trained to replace touch for hearing with the use of a sensor glove, or to a control group, untrained. Training group volunteers had to identify textures just by the sound. In an fMRI experiment, all subjects received three types of stimuli: tactile only, combined audiotactile stimulation, and auditory only. Results indicate that, for trained subjects, a coupling between auditory and somatosensory cortical areas is established through associative areas. Differences in signal correlation between groups point to a pairing mechanism, which, at first, connects functionally the primary auditory and sensory areas (trained subjects). Later, this connection seems to be mediated by associative areas. The training with the sensor glove influences cortical audiotactile integration mechanisms, determining BOLD signal changes in the somatosensory area during auditory stimulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The experiment explored the effects of vibrotactile feedback in combination with audio frequency discrimination for the same f0 of 160 Hz. The potential of a correctly identified result for two separate groups were measured and then compared. Group A subjects were given an audio only JND test via headphones, whilst group B were given the same test with additional vibrotactile stimulus delivered via the Audio-tactile Glove.

@article{PrattichizzoAl2012:CutaneousForce,
abstract = {A novel sensory substitution technique is presented. Kinesthetic and cutaneous force feedback are substituted by cutaneous feedback only, provided by two wearable devices able to apply forces to the index finger and the thumb, while holding a handle during a teleoperation task. The force pattern, fed back to the user while using the cutaneous devices, is similar, in terms of intensity and area of application, to the cutaneous force pattern applied to the finger pad while interacting with a haptic device providing both cutaneous and kinesthetic force feedback. The pattern generated using the cutaneous devices can be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic feedback and the kinesthetic part of it. For this reason, we refer to this approach as sensory subtraction instead of sensory substitution. A needle insertion scenario is considered to validate the approach. The haptic device is connected to a virtual environment simulating a needle insertion task. Experiments show that the perception of inserting a needle using the cutaneous-only force feedback is nearly indistinguishable from the one felt by the user while using both cutaneous and kinesthetic feedback. Asmost of the sensory substitution approaches, the proposed sensory subtraction technique also has the advantage of not suffering from stability issues of teleoperation systems due, for instance, to communication delays. Moreover, experiments show that the sensory subtraction technique outperforms sensory substitution with more conventional visual feedback.},

abstract = {Background. A musical instrument is a device for producing musical tones. Therefore engineers traditionally associate the quality of the musical instrument with the quality of the tones it produces. In turn, the quality of the tone is determined by its acoustical parameters. In this deterministic logic, it is quite possible to judge the quality of the instrument by the parameters of its tones, provided the relations between them are known. From an engineering point of view the playing comfort and tone quality of a musical instrument are usually assigned to different design units of a musical instrument (e.g. key action vs. sound unit in pianos), For this reason, instrument designers like to have expert musicians' judgments of an instrument separated in acoustical and mechanical qualities. Aims. We want to show, that this separation is not reliable under normal playing conditions due to psychological reasons. Practical ways of avoiding the problem are discussed. Main contribution. Our experimental data suggest that the performer's impression of the quality of a musical instrument received simultaneously over the auditory and kinesthetic sensory channels are not additive. Cross-modal interference is a plausible explanation to why musicians confuse these impressions. Multimodal perception of a musical instrument by the performer and listener, respectively, is analyzed. Implications. 1) Improving procedures of quality assessment in musical instrument industry; 2) Solving, on a psychological level, the classical controversy between musicians and physicists of touch dependence of a piano tone.},

In order to determine how such sensory inputs are integrated, we obtained whole-cell recordings in mouse dorsal striatum during presentation of tactile and visual stimuli. All recorded neurons responded to bilateral whisker stimulation, and a subpopulation also responded to visual stimulation. Neurons responding to both visual and tactile stimuli were located in dorsomedial striatum, whereas those responding only to whisker deflections were located dorsolaterally. Responses were mediated by overlapping excitation and inhibition, with excitation onset preceding that of inhibition by several milliseconds. Responses differed according to the type of neuron, with direct pathway MSNs having larger responses and longer latencies between ipsilateral and contralateral responses than indirect pathway MSNs. Our results suggest that striatum acts as a sensory "hub" with specialized functional roles for the different neuron types. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Musicians often say that they not only hear, but also "feel" music. To explore the contribution of tactile information in "feeling" musical rhythm, we investigated the degree that auditory and tactile inputs are integrated in humans performing a musical meter recognition task. Subjects discriminated between two types of sequences, 'duple' (march-like rhythms) and 'triple' (waltz-like rhythms) presented in three conditions: 1) Unimodal inputs (auditory or tactile alone), 2) Various combinations of bimodal inputs, where sequences were distributed between the auditory and tactile channels such that a single channel did not produce coherent meter percepts, and 3) Simultaneously presented bimodal inputs where the two channels contained congruent or incongruent meter cues. We first show that meter is perceived similarly well (70{\%}-85{\%}) when tactile or auditory cues are presented alone. We next show in the bimodal experiments that auditory and tactile cues are integrated to produce coherent meter percepts. Performance is high (70{\%}-90{\%}) when all of the metrically important notes are assigned to one channel and is reduced to 60{\%} when half of these notes are assigned to one channel. When the important notes are presented simultaneously to both channels, congruent cues enhance meter recognition (90{\%}). Performance drops dramatically when subjects were presented with incongruent auditory cues (10{\%}), as opposed to incongruent tactile cues (60{\%}), demonstrating that auditory input dominates meter perception. We believe that these results are the first demonstration of cross-modal sensory grouping between any two senses.},

abstract = {This review addresses the question of when spatial coincidence facilitates multisensory integration in humans. According to the spatial rule (which was first formulated on the basis of neurophysiological data in anesthetized animals), multisensory integration is enhanced when stimuli in different sensory modalities are presented from the same spatial location. While the spatial rule fits with the available data from studies of overt and covert spatial attentional orienting, and from the majority of those studies in which space has been somehow relevant to the participant's task, it is inconsistent with the evidence that has emerged from the majority of multisensory studies of stimulus identification and temporal perception. Such a mixed pattern of behavioral results suggests that the spatial rule does not represent a general constraint on multisensory integration in humans. Instead, it would appear to be a much more task-dependent phenomenon than is often realized. These results, however, are broadly consistent with a distinction between the processing of "where" and "what" (or "how") information processing in the human brain.},

Fifteen violinists evaluated three violins on four criteria-"Rich Sound," "Loud and Powerful," "Alive and Responsive," and "Pleasure"-during a perceptual experiment. Violinists first evaluated the violins one at a time under three experimental conditions: (1) playing, (2) listening to it (played by a professional player) in an active way by fingering the score on an isolated neck, (3) same as (2) with vibrotactile feedback provided at the isolated neck. Violinists were then asked to evaluate the violins through pairwise comparisons under condition (3): Each violin was paired with itself while the level of vibrations of the isolated neck was either the original one or divided by two. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that Loud and Powerful judgments were affected by the presence of vibrations given that violins were rated louder in condition (3) than in (2). In the second part, violins were rated more positively with original vibration level at the isolated neck than with half the level, for all criteria but Alive and Responsive. Consistently with sensory interaction, the magnitude of the enhancement remained relatively constant across violins.},

@phdthesis{Saitis2014,
abstract = {This thesis addresses the perceptual evaluation of violins from the player perspective. Three carefully controlled violin-playing studies were carried out, wherein experienced musicians assessed violins of different make and age, and described their choices in open-ended questionnaires. The focus was gradually narrowed from examining overall preference (Study 1) to the evaluation of certain perceptual attributes of the violin (Studies 2 and 3). Two distinct yet complementary approaches were followed: a systematic investigation into the reliability of preference judgments, and an exploratory analysis of concepts emerging from impromptu preference verbalizations.Study 1 examined both intra- and inter-player consistency in repetitive violin preference rankings. It was found that violinists are self-consistent when evaluating different instruments but a significant lack of agreement between musicians was observed. Study 2 investigated the origin of inter-individual differences and measured the extent to which different attributes of the instrument influence preference. Results showed that whereas violinists tend to agree of what particular qualities they look for in an instrument—preference was strongly associated with sound richness and, to a lesser extent, dynamic range—the perception of the same attributes widely varies across individuals. Study 3 focused on the evaluation of richness and dynamic range in constrained (playing only certain notes on certain registers) vs. unconstrained (playing a certain excerpt from the classical repertoire) tasks. The perception of richness from playing vs. listening tasks (using recorded sounds from the playing task) was also examined. Results suggested that specifying the musical material and technique removes a significant amount of inter-player variability: the more focused the task, the more self-consistent violinists are and the more they agree with each other. From verbal responses collected in the first and second studies, a categorization scheme emerged that illustrates the complex links between the different player-typical concepts (e.g., response, clarity, balance), properties (e.g., ease, richness, projection), and underlying themes (handling, sound and their relevance to the individual). A psycholinguistic analysis of the quality-relevant lexicon showed a diversity of linguistic devices borrowed mainly from four semantic fields (perceptual dimensions) related to texture-temperature (smooth vs. rough), action-presence (resonant vs. muted), size-volume (deep vs. flat) and light (dark vs. bright). Richness, associated with the perceived amount of low-to-mid harmonics in the sound, was identified as a key perceptual factor in evaluating violin quality.},

abstract = {A tool for the multisensory stylus-based exploration of virtual textures was used to investigate how different feedback modalities (static or dynamically deformed images, vibration, sound) affect exploratory gestures. To this end, we ran an experiment where participants had to steer a path with the stylus through a curved corridor on the surface of a graphic tablet/display, and we measured steering time, dispersion of trajectories, and applied force. Despite the variety of subjective impressions elicited by the different feedback conditions, we found that only nonvisual feedback induced significant variations in trajectories and an increase in movement time. In a post-experiment, using a paper-and-wood physical realization of the same texture, we recorded a variety of gestural behaviors markedly different from those found with the virtual texture. With the physical setup, movement time was shorter and texture-dependent lateral accelerations could be observed. This work highlights the limits of multisensory pseudo-haptic techniques in the exploration of surface textures.},

Screen objects such as windows, buttons, sliders, and pull-down menus are mapped to the workspace of a two-axis haptic interface called the Moose where they emerge as patches and lines of varying resistance. The Moose operates much like a mouse except that it is able to move under its own power and thereby make apparent touchable virtual objects. Thus presented to the hand. interface objects may be located. identified, and even manipulated or activated.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the addition of binary vibrotactile stimulation to continuous auditory feedback (vowel synthesis) for human-machine-interface (HMI) control. Sixteen healthy participants controlled facial surface electromyography to achieve two-dimensional (2D) targets (vowels). Eight participants used only real-time auditory feedback to locate targets whereas the other eight participants were additionally alerted to having achieved targets with confirmatory vibrotactile stimulation at the index finger. All participants trained using their assigned feedback modality (auditory alone or combined auditory and vibrotactile) over three sessions on three days and completed a fourth session on the third day using novel targets to assess generalization. Analyses of variance performed on the 1) percentage of targets reached and 2) percentage of trial time at the target revealed a main effect for feedback modality: participants using combined auditory and vibrotactile feedback performed significantly better than those using auditory feedback alone. No effect was found for session or the interaction of feedback modality and session, indicating a successful generalization to novel targets but lack of improvement over training sessions. Future research is necessary to determine the cognitive cost associated with combined auditory and vibrotactile feedback during HMI control.},

abstract = {We investigated how auditory and haptic information about the hardness of objects is integrated for the purpose of controlling the velocity with which we strike an object. Our experimental manipulations and data analyses considered a variety of factors that should be integrated in a theory of multisensory per- ception: expertise of the perceiver; context (unimodal vs. multimodal); between-modalities congruence; between-participants agreement in sensory weighting; performance. On a trial, participants struck a virtual object with a target constant velocity and received feedback on correctness. When the performance criterion was reached, feedback was eliminated, the auditory and/or haptic hardness of the struck object were changed, and the effects on subsequent striking velocity and performance were measured. In unimodal trials only the haptic or auditory display was presented. In multisensory trials, the audio-haptic changes could be congruent (e.g., both increased in hardness) or incongruent. We recruited participants with different levels of expertise with the task: percussionists, nonpercussionist musicians and nonmusicians. For both modalities, striking velocity increased with decreasing hardness, and vice versa. With the vast majority of participants, changes in haptic hardness were perceptually more relevant because they influ- enced striking velocity to a greater degree than changes in auditory hardness. The perceptual weighting of auditory information was robust to context variations (unimodal vs. multimodal), independent of exper- tise, uniform across participants and modulated by audio-haptic congruence. The perceptual weighting of haptic information was modulated by context and expertise, more varied across participants and robust to changes in audio-haptic congruence. Performance in tracking velocity was more strongly affected by haptic than auditory information, was not at its best in a multisensory context and was independent of information congruence.},

abstract = {The modality of touch encompasses distinct cutaneous, kinesthetic and haptic systems that are distinguished on the basis of the underlying neural inputs. The cutaneous receptors are embedded in the skin; the kinesthetic receptors lie in muscles, tendons, and joints; and the haptic system uses combined inputs from both. Topics in this chapter range from sensory phenomena, such as threshold-level responses, to cognitive and memory processes associated with the haptic system. Haptic perception extracts properties of objects and surfaces that lead to recognition of objects. Material properties are highly accessible, relative to geometric properties, providing a contrast between haptics and vision. The haptic system provides a map of space within reach of the body that provides the basis for recognition of two-dimensional patterns and outline drawings. The spatial map is subject to systematic distortion, particularly as a result of the movements used in exploration. Interactions between haptic and visual perception are described with respect to attention, representation, and memory. As do other modalities, the sense of touch gives rise to implicit and explicit forms of memory. The chapter concludes with applications of research on touch, including aids for the blind and deaf and virtual environments that provide haptic feedback.},

@article{Lalanne2004,
abstract = {The integration of information from different sensory modalities has many advantages for human observers, including increase of salience, resolution of perceptual ambiguities, and unified perception of objects and surroundings. Several behavioral, electrophysiological and neuroimaging data collected in various tasks, including localization and detection of spatial events, crossmodal perception of object properties and scene analysis are reviewed here. All the results highlight the multiple faces of crossmodal interactions and provide converging evidence that the brain takes advantages of spatial and temporal coincidence between spatial events in the crossmodal binding of spatial features gathered through different modalities. Furthermore, the elaboration of a multimodal percept appears to be based on an adaptive combination of the contribution of each modality, according to the intrinsic reliability of sensory cue, which itself depends on the task at hand and the kind of perceptual cues involved in sensory processing. Computational models based on bayesian sensory estimation provide valuable explanations of the way perceptual system could perform such crossmodal integration. Recent anatomical evidence suggest that crossmodal interactions affect early stages of sensory processing, and could be mediated through a dynamic recurrent network involving backprojections from multimodal areas as well as lateral connections that can modulate the activity of primary sensory cortices, though future behavioral and neurophysiological studies should allow a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

@article{LagardeKelso:movementSoundTouch,
abstract = {Very little is known about the coordination of movement in combination with stimuli such as sound and touch. The present research investigates the hypothesis that both the type of action (e.g., a flexion or extension movement) and the sensory modality (e.g., auditory or tactile) determine the stability of multimodal coordination. We performed a parametric study in which the ability to synchronize movement, touch and sound was explored over a broad range of stimulus frequencies or rates. As expected, synchronization of finger movement with external auditory and tactile stimuli was successfully established and maintained across all frequencies. In the key experimental conditions, participants were instructed to synchronize peak flexion of the index finger with touch and peak extension with sound (and vice-versa). In this situation, tactile and auditory stimuli were delivered counter-phase to each other. Two key effects were observed. First, switching between multimodal coordination patterns occurred, with transitions selecting one multimodal pattern (flexion with sound and extension with touch) more often than its partner. This finding indicates that the stability of multimodal coordination is influenced by both the type of action and the stimulus modality. Second, at higher rates, transitions from coherent to incoherent phase relations between touch, movement and sound occurred, attesting to the breakdown of multimodal coordination. Because timing errors in multimodal coordination were systematically altered when compared to unimodal control conditions we are led to consider the role played by time delays in multimodal coordination dynamics.},

This study focuses on the comparison between ebony-fingerboard and rosewood-fingerboard guitars: is achange in the fingerboard wood perceivedbythe guitar players? In order to test the hypothesis that it is actually perceived, apsychological investigation is carried out. Twoexperimental methods are used: afree sorting task with recorded stimuli from the guitars (listening test)and afree verbali- sation task where the guitarists play the guitars. In the listening test, the guitarists perceive differences between guitars, butthe resulting clusters do not showanebony/rosewood dichotomy.Alinguistic analysis of the verbali- sations exhibits psychological descriptors that are relevant for the discrimination of the wood of the fingerboard: PRECISION (referring to howeach note stands out from others), and to alesser extent ATTACK (referring to the guitar'sresponse to musician'sgesture)and BALANCE (referring to the frequencycontent). This study is part of abroader project aiming at establishing an explicite relation between mechanics, perception, and lutherie. A physical interpretation of the psychologically-relevant descriptors is eventually proposed in order to use them as hypotheses in afurther hypothetico-deductive approach starting from physics and using psychophysical methods.},

Participants had to match the level of the acoustic stimuli while ignoring the tactile stimulation. The loudness matching experiment was carried out for four sinusoidal tones, at the frequencies of 10, 20, 63 and 200 Hz. Three different vibration levels (4, 8 and 12 dB above the vibration threshold for each participant) were used to study the influence of the vibration amplitude. Results indicate that whole-body vibration had a significant influence on loudness perception. When an acoustic stimulus was accompanied by vibration, the level of the acoustic stimulus was perceived one decibel higher on average.},

Haptic stimuli were presented via the PHANToM; visual stimuli were presented via computer monitor. The virtual surfaces were sinusoidal gratings that varied in spatial period across trials. Overall, results suggested that threshold was determined by haptic input at low surface amplitudes, and by visual input at high surface amplitudes. At intermediate amplitude values, it appeared that observers were combining information across modalities to produce a percept in the combined condition that was better than that obtained under either single modality condition.},

abstract = {Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs) .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging. One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile stimuli are defined in terms of their amplitude, frequency, waveform and temporal profile all of which have been varied to create tactons. A number of approaches have been adopted to design tactons including multidimensional scaling, iterative empirical methods and using perceptual processing models. The objective of the present set of experiments was to create sets of tactons based on the properties of the dimensions of vibrotactile stimuli. An absolute identification paradigm was used in which each of nine tactons was presented eight times using a tactor mounted on either the index finger or forearm. It was found that tactons created by varying the frequency, amplitude and temporal profile of the vibrotactile stimuli were correctly identified on 73-83 percent of the trials, with a mean information transfer of 2.41 bits. The latter metric indicates that for these sets of nine tactons between five and six could be reliably identified. The vibrotactile stimuli delivered in the experiments were identified as consistently on the forearm as the hand and the IT values were similar at the two locations. This suggests that sites other than the hand can be used effectively in tactile communication systems and that it is channel capacity that ultimately determines performance on this type of task.},

abstract = {Temporal frequency is a fundamental sensory dimension in audition and touch. In audition, analysis of temporal frequency is necessary for speech and music perception; in touch, the spectral analysis of vibratory signals has been implicated in texture perception and in sensing the environment through tools. Environmental oscillations impinging upon the ear are generally thought to be processed independently of oscillations impinging upon the skin. Here, we show that frequency channels are perceptually linked across audition and touch. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we demonstrate that auditory stimuli interfere with tactile frequency perception in a systematic manner. Specifically, performance on a tactile-frequency-discrimination task is impaired when an auditory distractor is presented with the tactile stimuli, but only if the frequencies of the auditory and tactile stimuli are similar. The frequency-dependent interference effect is observed whether the distractors are pure tones or band-pass noise, so an auditory percept of pitch is not required for the effect to be produced. Importantly, distractors that strongly impair frequency discrimination do not interfere with judgments of tactile intensity. This surprisingly specific crosstalk between different modalities reflects the importance of supramodal representations of fundamental sensory dimensions.},

Providing haptic feedback of variables relevant to manipulation, such as contact force, may thus improve the usability of prosthetic hands for tasks of daily living. Vibrotactile stimulation was explored as a feedback modality in ten unimpaired participants across eight sessions in a two-week period. Participants used their right index finger to perform a virtual object manipulation task with both visual and augmentative vibrotactile feedback related to force. Through repeated training, participants were able to learn to use the vibrotactile feedback to significantly improve object manipulation. Removal of vibrotactile feedback in session 8 significantly reduced task performance. These results suggest that vibrotactile feedback paired with training may enhance the manipulation ability of prosthetic hand users without the need for more invasive strategies.},

abstract = {One of the most vital feedback systems that has been embedded in musicians for centuries is that of physical response. In the same way that auditory information is available and used throughout a performance, a musician will continuously reassess their playing by making use of not only their specialised sensorimotor skills, but also the tangible feedback that is relayed to them through the body of the instrument. This paper discusses approaches to the development of an augmented instrument, namely the hybrid piano, which focuses on the notion of performance as perceptually guided action. While the acoustic component of the sound energy of the augmented instrument is created within the real- world interactions between hammers, resonating strings, and the soundboard, the digital sonic events cannot be located in a similar palpable source. By exploring notions of multimodality and haptic feedback, the ongoing processes of human action and perception within instrumental performance can be maintained for the player, whilst arguably, also enhancing the experience for the listener.},

abstract = {The role of auditory and tactile modalities involved in violin playing and evaluation was investigated in an experiment employing a blind violin evaluation task under different conditions: i) normal playing conditions, ii) playing with auditory masking, and iii) playing with vibrotactile masking. Under each condition, 20 violinists evaluated five violins according to criteria related to violin playing and sound characteristics and rated their overall quality and relative preference. Results show that both auditory and vibrotactile feedback are important in the violinists' evaluations but that their relative importance depends on the violinist, the violin and the type of evaluation (different criteria ratings or preference). In this way, the overall quality ratings were found to be accurately predicted by the rating criteria, which also proved to be perceptually relevant to violinists, but were poorly correlated with the preference ratings; this suggests that the two types of ratings (overall quality vs preference) may stem from different decision-making strategies. Furthermore, the experimental design confirmed that violinists agree more on the importance of criteria in their overall evaluation than on their actual ratings for different violins. In particular, greater agreement was found on the importance of criteria related to the sound of the violin. Nevertheless, this study reveals that there are fundamental differences in the way players interpret and evaluate each criterion, which may explain why correlating physical properties with perceptual properties has been challenging so far in the field of musical acoustics.},

abstract = {The widespread availability of high-performance, affordable personal computers has brought a new wealth of possibilities regarding real-time control of musical parameters. In fact, real-time gestural control of computer music has become a major trend in recent years (e.g., Wanderley and Battier 2000). Various input devices for musical expression— also called hardware interfaces, control surfaces,or (gestural) controllers—have been proposed (Penny- cook 1985; Roads 1996; Paradiso 1997; Mulder 1998; Bongers 2000, Cook 2001; Piringer 2001). These devices can be roughly classified into several categories: instrument-like controllers that try to emulate the control interfaces of existing acoustic instruments; instrument-inspired controllers that are basically designed loosely following the charac- teristics of existing instruments (but that do not necessarily seek an emulation of their counter- parts); extended instruments, that is, acoustic in- struments augmented by the use of several sensors; and alternate controllers, whose designs do not fol- low that of any existing instrument. A more careful examination reveals two main trends behind these categories: the tendency to de- sign controllers to best fit some already developed motor control ability (the case of the first three categories), or an attempt to deliberately avoid any relationship to gestural vocabularies associated to existing instruments, therefore allowing the use of different movements and postures not traditionally used in music performance.},

abstract = {Many researchers have sought explanations for the purported tonal superiority of Old Italian violins by investigating varnish and wood properties, plate tuning systems, and the spectral balance of the radiated sound. Nevertheless, the fundamental premise of tonal superiority has been investigated scientifically only once very recently, and results showed a general preference for new violins and that players were unable to reliably distinguish new violins from old. The study was, however, relatively small in terms of the number of violins tested (six), the time allotted to each player (an hour), and the size of the test space (a hotel room). In this study, 10 renowned soloists each blind-tested six Old Italian violins (including five by Stradivari) and six new during two 75-min sessions-the first in a rehearsal room, the second in a 300-seat concert hall. When asked to choose a violin to replace their own for a hypothetical concert tour, 6 of the 10 soloists chose a new instrument. A single new violin was easily the most-preferred of the 12. On average, soloists rated their favorite new violins more highly than their favorite old for playability, articulation, and projection, and at least equal to old in terms of timbre. Soloists failed to distinguish new from old at better than chance levels. These results confirm and extend those of the earlier study and present a striking challenge to near-canonical beliefs about Old Italian violins.},

abstract = {Hearing and feeling both rely upon the transduction of physical events into frequency-based neural codes, suggesting that the auditory system may be intimately related to the somatosensory system. Here, we provide evidence that the neural substrates for audition and somatosensation are anatomically linked. Using diffusion tensor imaging with both deterministic and probabilistic tractography to measure white matter connectivity, we show that there are extensive ipsilateral connections between the primary auditory cortex and the primary and secondary somatosensory regions in the human cerebral cortex. We further show that these cross-modal connections are exaggerated between the auditory and secondary somatosensory cortex in the lesioned hemisphere of a patient (SR) with acquired auditory-tactile synesthesia, in whom sounds alone produce bodily sensations. These results provide an anatomical basis for multisensory interactions between audition and somatosensation and suggest that cross-talk between these regions may explain why some sounds, such as nails screeching down a chalkboard or an audible mosquito, can induce feelings of touch, especially on the contralesional body surface of patient SR.},

A holistic approach is taken, considering the role of new instru- ments in electronic music, as well as the concept of touch in culture and experience. Research about the human biological systems that enable vibrotactile perception is reviewed, with a special focus on its relevance to music. Out of this review, an approach to vibration synthesis is developed that integrates the current understand- ing of human vibrotactile perception. An account of musical vibrotactile interaction design is presented, which includes the implementation of a vibrotactile feedback synthesizer and the construction of two hardware prototypes that display musical vibration.},

The task consisted in pressing the fingertip against a flat rigid surface which provided broadband vibration noise of varying amplitude. Three force levels were considered, ranging from light touch to hard press. Possibly due to the concurrent effect of large contact area, spectrally complex stimuli and active pressing force, the measured sensitivity thresholds are considerably lower than what is found in most of the previous literature. Moreover, significant differences in thresholds were found between the lowest and middle force level, and the highest and middle force level.},

@article{Tsai2012,
abstract = {Identification of a visual target can be enhanced by a simultaneously presented high tone embedded in a sequence of low tones. This is called "freezing effect" because it is as if the target display was frozen in time by the tone. Until now, however, it has not been known whether this sound facilitation effect exists for a target with modalities other than vision, such as tactility, and if so, what its underlying mechanism is. We demonstrate, for the first time, an audio-tactile freezing effect (Experiment 1). We use a method of constant stimuli in conjunction with a 2-AFC task to determine the point of subjective equality (PSE) of the duration (Experiment 2A) or intensity (Experiment 2B) of the tactile target. Results do not support the view that a high tone expands the duration of the tactile target, but rather that the tone enhances participants' subjective tactile intensity. When the tactile intensity of the target was increased to match the shift of PSE as in Experiment 2B, this increased intensity indeed improved identification, further suggesting that intensity enhancement is the mechanism (Experiment 3). The perceived tactile intensity enhancement by a sound indicates genuine multisensory integration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).},

abstract = {Acoustic speech is easier to detect in noise when the talker can be seen. This finding could be explained by integration of multisensory inputs or refinement of auditory processing from visual guidance. In two experiments, we studied two-interval forced-choice detection of an auditory 'ba' in acoustic noise, paired with various visual and tactile stimuli that were identically presented in the two observation intervals. Detection thresholds were reduced under the multisensory conditions vs. the auditory-only condition, even though the visual and/or tactile stimuli alone could not inform the correct response. Results were analysed relative to an ideal observer for which intrinsic (internal) noise and efficiency were independent contributors to detection sensitivity. Across experiments, intrinsic noise was unaffected by the multisensory stimuli, arguing against the merging (integrating) of multisensory inputs into a unitary speech signal, but sampling efficiency was increased to varying degrees, supporting refinement of knowledge about the auditory stimulus. The steepness of the psychometric functions decreased with increasing sampling efficiency, suggesting that the 'task-irrelevant' visual and tactile stimuli reduced uncertainty about the acoustic signal. Visible speech was not superior for enhancing auditory speech detection. Our results reject multisensory neuronal integration and speech-specific neural processing as explanations for the enhanced auditory speech detection under noisy conditions. Instead, they support a more rudimentary form of multisensory interaction: the otherwise task-irrelevant sensory systems inform the auditory system about when to listen.},

abstract = {Perception of our environment is a multisensory experience; information from different sensory systems like the auditory, visual and tactile is constantly integrated. Complex tasks that require high temporal and spatial precision of multisensory integration put strong demands on the underlying networks but it is largely unknown how task experience shapes multisensory processing. Long-term musical training is an excellent model for brain plasticity because it shapes the human brain at functional and structural levels, affecting a network of brain areas. In the present study we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how audio-tactile perception is integrated in the human brain and if musicians show enhancement of the corresponding activation compared to non-musicians. Using a paradigm that allowed the investigation of combined and separate auditory and tactile processing, we found a multisensory incongruency response, generated in frontal, cingulate and cerebellar regions, an auditory mismatch response generated mainly in the auditory cortex and a tactile mismatch response generated in frontal and cerebellar regions. The influence of musical training was seen in the audio-tactile as well as in the auditory condition, indicating enhanced higher-order processing in musicians, while the sources of the tactile MMN were not influenced by long-term musical training. Consistent with the predictive coding model, more basic, bottom-up sensory processing was relatively stable and less affected by expertise, whereas areas for top-down models of multisensory expectancies were modulated by training.},

abstract = {This paper reports a preliminary study based on the theoretical assumption that continuous closed-loop audio-motor control could be disadvantageous for pianists. It is argued that the functional relationship between the intracerebral electrical activations in the auditory and premotor cortex should be rhythmically decreased and increased. To test this hypothesis, intracerebral electrical activations for the auditory and premotor cortex were estimated using scalp EEG and standardized low-resolution electrical tomography (sLORETA). The extracted times series were subjected to a Granger causality analysis, revealing a causal relationship from the auditory cortex to the premotor cortex that was considerably stronger during piano playing and weaker during rest. Importantly, this relationship varied rhythmically during the course of piano playing, with lags (obtained with cross-correlations) between 666 ms and 820 milliseconds. This study thus delivers evidence that the functional coupling between the auditory and premotor cortex varies during piano playing.},

abstract = {In our daily lives, we usually perceive an event via more than one sensory modality (e.g., vision, hearing, touch). Therefore, multimodal integration and interactions play an important role when we use objects and for event recognition in our environment. A virtual environment (VE) is a computer simulation of a realistic-looking and interactive world. VEs should take into account the multisensory nature of humans and communicate with the user not only through vision but also through other modalities. In addition to vision, hearing and touch are the most commonly used communication channels. Recently, a variety of products with additional tactile input and output capabilities have been developed (e.g., Apple iPhone and other touch-screen devices, NintendoWii, etc.). Some of these devices provide new possibilities for interacting with a computer, including the auditory modality. Binaural synthesis and rendering are becoming key technologies for multimedia products. Virtual environments are no longer limited to academic research; they have commercial applications, particularly in medicine, game, and entertainment industries. Thus, the quality of VEs is becoming increasingly important. User interaction with a VE is a key issue in the perception of its quality. Several studies have discussed the quality of displays, input and output devices (for different modalities) as well as software and hardware issues; however, multimodal user interaction should also be examined. This paper focuses on the parameters that influence the quality of audio-tactile VEs.},

The instrument described in this study is based on a virtual control surface that player strikes with a hand held sensor-actuator device. We designed two tactile cues to augment the stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface. We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance. In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all. The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument.},
