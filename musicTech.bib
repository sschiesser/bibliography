abstract = {This paper focuses on the Sensor Augmented Bass clar- inet Research (SABRe) in terms of musical practice, in- strumentalist skills and compositional approaches. After a short overviewof the concept of embodiment and instru- ment, the new possibilities of the SABRe instrument are exposed. Then, the first realized compositions present the strategies they deploy in view of the new control modal- ities and the exploration of affordances this augmented bass clarinet offers. Finally, some possible improvements and perspectives are outlined.},

@inproceedings{Schiesser2012b,
abstract = {An augmented bass clarinet is developed in order to extend the performance and composition potential of the instru- ment. Four groups of sensors are added: key positions, in- ertial movement, mouth pressure and trigger switches. The instrument communicates wirelessly with a receiver setup which produces an OSC data stream, usable by any appli- cation on a host computer. The SABRe projects intention is to be neither tied to its inventors nor to one single player but to offer a reference design for a larger community of bass clarinet players and composers. For this purpose, several instruments are made available and a number of composer residencies, workshops, presentations and concerts are organized. These serve for evaluation and improvement purposes in order to build a robust and user friendly extended musical instrument, that opens new playing modalities.},

abstract = {The Gumstix embedded computers provide interesting and modular platforms to develop embedded applications. Sev- eral features are already built-in in the base image of the operating system and a development framework allows to customize it for specific needs. AMIDI-to-OSC converter has been developed with these Abstract products. It currently shows competitive timing characteris- tics for short MIDI messages. Furthermore, this tool will be developed to a more generic sensors-to-OSC converter and used for artistic purposes or quick interfacing of gesture acquisition devices.},
