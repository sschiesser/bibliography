@article{Bolanowski1988,
abstract = {Although previous physiological and anatomical experiments have identified four afferent fiber types (PC, RA, SA II, and SA I) in glabrous (nonhairy) skin of the human somatosensory periphery, only three have been shown to mediate tactile (mechanoreceptive) sensation. Psychophysical evidence that four channels (P, NP I, NP II, and NP III) do, indeed, participate in the perceptual process is presented. In a series of experiments involving selective masking of the various channels, modification of the skin-surface temperature, and testing cutaneous sensitivity down to very low-vibratory frequencies, the fourth psychophysical channel (NP III) is defined. Based on these experiments and previous work from our laboratory, it is concluded that the four channels work in conjunction at threshold to create an operating range for the perception of vibration that extends from at least 0.4 to greater than 500 Hz. Each of the four channels appears to mediate specific portions of the overall threshold-frequency characteristic. Selection of appropriate neural-response criteria from previously published physiological data and correlation of their derived frequency characteristics with the four psychophysical channels indicates that each channel has its own physiological substrate: P channel and PC fibers, NP I channel and RA fibers, NP II channel and SA II fibers, and NP III channel and SA I fibers. These channels partially overlap in their absolute sensitivities, making it likely that suprathreshold stimuli may activate two or more of the channels at the same time. Thus the perceptual qualities of touch may be determined by the combined inputs from four channels.},

abstract = {A measuring method for the vibration perception threshold (VPT) of fingers has been developed. The VPTs of 118 and 149 professional forest workers were measured during a compulsory annual health examination in 1979 and 1983, respectively. Also the VPTs of eight pedestal grinders, who were suffering vibration-induced white finger (VWF), were measured in 1979 and 1983. The control group consisted of 20 research workers who had no vibration exposure in the past and no symptoms in their hands. The measuring system for VPT gave repeatable results. The frequency of the most sensitive VPT of vibration exposed workers alternated between 63 and 125 Hz instead of 125 Hz of subjects without vibration exposure. The VPT of the pedestal grinders and forest workers with decreased hand grip force and with vibration-induced white finger were significantly higher than those of the controls. The VPTs of the forest workers decreased slightly and that of the grinders increased from 1979 to 1983. In spite of long vibration exposure in the past and continuing lower level vibration exposure, the increased VPT of forest workers does not seem to be permanent.},

@article{Ekenvall1989,
abstract = {To evaluate neurological symptoms in the vibration syndrome, 55 patients with vascular and neurological symptoms in the hand who had been exposed to vibration were examined. Their exposure to vibration was estimated and neurological vascular symptoms were evaluated according to symptom scales. Temperature thresholds were measured on the right thenar eminence and on the distal volar aspect of the second and third fingers held together on both sides. Vibration thresholds were measured dorsally on the second and fifth metacarpal bones and on the second and fifth fingers proximal to the nail roots. Subjects with advanced neurological symptoms had higher temperature and vibration thresholds than subjects with less advanced symptoms. No such relation was found between vascular symptoms and the outcome of sensory testing. Thus neurological but not vascular symptoms are reflected by the outcome of quantitative sensory testing. In subjects with advanced neurological symptoms the tests gave a high proportion of abnormal results, indicating that these tests may be used for the diagnosis of vibration syndrome on an individual basis. Patients with advanced vascular and neurological symptoms had higher exposure dose scores than patients with less advanced symptoms, indicating a dose response relation between vibration "dose" and neurological and vascular symptoms.},

@article{SalisburyAl2011:EvalHapticHardware,
abstract = {In this paper, we extend the concept of the contrast sensitivity function - used to evaluate video projectors - to the evaluation of haptic devices. We propose using human observers to determine if vibrations rendered using a given haptic device are accompanied by artifacts detectable to humans. This determination produces a performance measure that carries particular relevance to applications involving texture rendering. For cases in which a device produces detectable artifacts, we have developed a protocol that localizes deficiencies in device design and/or hardware implementation. In this paper, we present results from human vibration detection experiments carried out using three commercial haptic devices and one high performance voice coil motor. We found that all three commercial devices produced perceptible artifacts when rendering vibrations near human detection thresholds. Our protocol allowed us to pinpoint the deficiencies, however, and we were able to show that minor modifications to the haptic hardware were sufficient to make these devices well suited for rendering vibrations, and by extension, the vibratory components of textures. We generalize our findings to provide quantitative design guidelines that ensure the ability of haptic devices to proficiently render the vibratory components of textures.},

@article{ChubbAl:2010:ShiverPaD,
abstract = {We discuss the design and performance of a new haptic surface capable of controlling shear force on a bare finger. At the heart of the ShiverPaD is the TPaD variable friction device. It modulates the friction of a glass surface by using 39 kHz out-of-plane vibrations to reduce friction. To generate shear forces, the TPaD is oscillated in-plane (i.e., “shivered”) while alternating between low and high friction within each cycle. In previous research, the ShiverPaD produced shear forces using in-plane vibrations below 100 Hz. In this research, we develop a new ShiverPaD that produces force using 854 Hz vibrations, where human sensitivity to vibration is diminished. The new device is used to display a virtual toggle switch and a variety of virtual edges. A human subject study is conducted to demonstrate that users can easily trace virtual edges displayed on the surface of the ShiverPaD.},

The task consisted in pressing the fingertip against a flat rigid surface which provided broadband vibration noise of varying amplitude. Three force levels were considered, ranging from light touch to hard press. Possibly due to the concurrent effect of large contact area, spectrally complex stimuli and active pressing force, the measured sensitivity thresholds are considerably lower than what is found in most of the previous literature. Moreover, significant differences in thresholds were found between the lowest and middle force level, and the highest and middle force level.},

@incollection{VanDoornAl:2012:CognitiveLoad,
abstract = {Active touch is often described as yielding “better-quality” information than passive touch. However, some authors have argued that passive-guided movements generate superior percepts due to a reduction in demands on the haptic sensory system. We consider the possibility that passive-guided conditions, as used in most active-passive comparisons, are relatively free from cognitive decision-making, while active conditions involve cognitive loads that are quite high and uncharacteristic of normal sensory processes. Thus studies that purport to show differences in active and passive touch may instead be revealing differences in the amount of cognition involved in active and passive tasks. We hypothesized that passive-guided conditions reduce not the sensory load but the cognitive load that active explorers must bear. To test this hypothesis Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) activity was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during active and passive-guided fingertip exploration of 2D raised line drawings. Active movements resulted in greater activation (compared with passive movements) in areas implicated in higher order processes such as monitoring and controlling of goal-directed behavior, attention, execution of movements, and error detection. Passive movements, in contrast, produced greater BOLD activity in areas associated with touch perception, length discrimination, tactile object recognition, and efference copy. The activation of a greater number of higher-order processing areas during active relative to passive-guided exploration suggests that instances of passive-guided superiority may not be due to the haptic system's limited ability to cope with sensory inputs, but rather the restriction imposed by the use of a single finger such that active exploration may require cognitive strategies not demanded in the passive condition. Our findings suggest that previous attempts to compare active and passive touch have, in order to simplify tasks, inadvertently introduced cognitive load at the expense of normal sensory inputs.},

@article{LamoreKeemink:VibesThreshForce,
abstract = {The shape of the psychophysical frequency threshold curve for vibrations presented to the skin in the frequency region 5-1000 Hz is strongly dependent on the static force that the vibrator exerts on the skin and on whether there is a rigid surround around the vibrating contactor (presence of contrast). Where there is no rigid surround, an increase in static force reduces the threshold in the high-frequency region and increases it at low frequencies. When the static forces are sufficiently large, the thresholds reach a minimum value above 30 Hz and a maximum one below 30 Hz, this being the crossover frequency. Under these conditions in the frequency region around 200 Hz, where the threshold is determined by the Pacini receptor system, the vibration sensitivities of finger pad and thenar eminence (glabrous skin) are equal, while the value for the inner side of the forearm (hairy skin) is 12 dB higher. However, when a rigid surround is used, the threshold increases above 30 Hz and decreases below 30 Hz. The latter increase in sensitivity, which is introduced by the presence of contrast cues, amounts to about 20 dB and is sharply tuned at 18 Hz for the glabrous skin of the finger. It is argued that in this case the threshold is determined by the Meissner receptor system. This increase in sensitivity is less pronounced (about 10 dB) and less sharply tuned for the other sites. Finally, when the contact of the vibrating surface to the skin is at a minimum, the vibration threshold has the same displacement value (about 3 microns) over the whole frequency region independent of the site of stimulation and whether or not a rigid surround is present.},

Previous work on gating mostly used electrocutaneous stimulation and did not allow focusing on tactile submodalities. Ten healthy adults participated in our study. Passive movement was achieved by swinging a platform, on which the participant's stimulated hand was attached, manually by a trained operator. The root-mean-square value of the movement speed was kept in a narrow range (slow: 10-20 cm/s, fast: 50-60 cm/s). Active movement was performed by the participant him-/herself using the same apparatus. The tactile stimuli consisted of 250-Hz sinusoidal mechanical vibrations, which were generated by a shaker mounted on the movement platform and applied to the middle fingertip. In the forward-masking experiments, a high-level masking stimulus preceded the test stimulus. Each movement condition was tested separately in a two-interval forced-choice detection task. Both passive and active movement caused a robust gating effect, that is, elevation of thresholds, in the fast speed range. Statistically significant change of thresholds was not found in slow movement conditions. Passive movement yielded higher thresholds than those measured during active movement, but this could not be confirmed statistically. On the other hand, the effect of forward masking was approximately constant as the movement condition varied. These results imply that gating depends on both peripheral and central factors in the P channel. Active movement may have some facilitatory role and produce less gating. Additionally, the results support the hypothesis regarding a critical speed for gating, which may be relevant for daily situations involving vibrations transmitted through grasped objects and for manual exploration.},

abstract = {Wearability will significantly increase the use of haptics in everyday life, as has already happened for audio and video technologies. The literature on wearable haptics is mainly focused on vibrotactile stimulation, and only recently, wearable devices conveying richer stimuli, like force vectors, have been proposed. This paper introduces design guidelines for wearable haptics and presents a novel 3-DoF wearable haptic interface able to apply force vectors directly to the fingertip. It consists of two platforms: a static one, placed on the back of the finger, and a mobile one, responsible for applying forces at the finger pad. The structure of the device resembles that of parallel robots, where the fingertip is placed in between the static and the moving platforms. This work presents the design of the wearable display, along with the quasi-static modeling of the relationship between the applied forces and the platform's orientation and displacement. The device can exert up to 1.5 N, with a maximum platform inclination of 30 degree. To validate the device and verify its effectiveness, a curvature discrimination experiment was carried out: employing the wearable device together with a popular haptic interface improved the performance with respect of employing the haptic interface alone.},

abstract = {A series of three experiments was carried out to determine the effects of variation of static force and contactor area on both absolute thresholds and the magnitude of vibrotactile stimuli at frequencies of 20, 80, and 250 Hz. The findings were: (a) If contactor penetration into the skin is constant, vibratory threshold amplitude falls off at the rate of 3 dB per doubling at 250 Hz, in agreement with previous studies, (b) There is no increase in vibrotactile magnitude with increase in area at constant amplitude, (c) Increasing static force on the contactor produces an increase in the vibrotactile magnitude. Also, changing contactor force can shift the exponent of the vibrotactile magnitude function. Some discussion is given of the questions raised by the present research, in particular the question of whether static conditions modify not only the mechanics of wave propagation, but also the excitability of neural systems in the tissues.},

To this end, we ran an experiment where participants had to steer a path with the stylus through a curved corridor on the surface of a graphic tablet/display, and we measured steering time, dispersion of trajectories, and applied force. Despite the variety of subjective impressions elicited by the different feedback conditions, we found that only nonvisual feedback induced significant variations in trajectories and an increase in movement time. In a post-experiment, using a paper-and-wood physical realization of the same texture, we recorded a variety of gestural behaviors markedly different from those found with the virtual texture. With the physical setup, movement time was shorter and texture-dependent lateral accelerations could be observed. This work highlights the limits of multisensory pseudo-haptic techniques in the exploration of surface textures.},

While there is the difference among individuals, it is well known that the threshold to vibration sensitivity as a function of frequency yields a U-shaped curve that reaches a maximum of sensitivity in the region of 250 Hz as shown in Fig.1. By focusing on this fact, we can evaluate which the vibration sensitivity is changed under the normal condition and the harder skin conditions caused by pressing the proximal phalange of finger forcibly. Through measuring the vibration sensitivity by the psychophysical method, we found that the vibration sensitivity at the frequency of 80 Hz and 120 Hz improves with the statistical significance test (p-value) of below 10 {\%}, but no effect was showed at the frequency of 10 Hz and 30 Hz.},

@article{HaradaGriffin1991,
abstract = {The effects of various conditions, including temporary threshold shifts (TTS) induced by exposure to vibration on vibration sense thresholds, have been investigated. The vibration sense thresholds of five subjects were measured on the middle fingertip of the left hand. A contactor with a diameter of 7 mm was surrounded by three alternative plates with holes of different sizes. The contact force was controlled at either 1 N, 2 N, or 3 N. For the TTS test, the left hand was exposed to vibration at 20 ms-2 rms for five minutes. The frequencies of both the exposure to vibration and the vibration threshold test were in the range 16 Hz to 500 Hz. Using a surround around the contactor greatly reduced the vibration sense threshold at 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz but increased the threshold at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz. An effect of contact force was seen only at the higher frequencies; larger contact forces led to lower thresholds at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz. As temperature of the finger skin decreased, the vibration thresholds increased, with the changes at higher frequencies greater than those at lower frequencies. The TTS at 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz measured 0.5 minutes after exposure to vibration (TTS0.5) were highest after exposures to vibration at lower frequencies. The TTS0.5 at 63 Hz was similar after exposure to all frequencies. The TTS0.5 values at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz were highest after exposures to vibration at 125 Hz and 250 Hz. It was apparent that the physiological characteristics of vibration sensation at low and high frequencies differed significantly. These findings suggest that two representative frequencies can be used when evaluation the neurological effects of occupational exposures to vibration by means of vibration sense thresholds.},

Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators. The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies.

In the two-burst-continuous-pedestal method with 1500-ms pedestals, the subject had to detect which of two successively presented pedestals contained a 500-ms amplitude increment. Thresholds were consistently lower for detecting increments in the amplitude of a continuous pedestal of vibration than for detecting amplitude differences between briefly presented successive pedestals or amplitude increments in successive pedestals.
