abstract = {Pairs of musicians were placed apart in isolated rooms and asked to clap a rhythm together. Each person monitored the other 's sound via headphones and microphone pickup which was as close as possible. Time delay from source to listener was manipulated across trials. Trials were recorded and clap onset times were measured with an event detection algorithm. Longer delays produced increasingly severe tempo deceleration and shorter delays ({\textless}11.5ms) produced a modest, but surprising acceleration. The study 's goal is to characterize effects of delay on rhythmic accuracy and identify the region most conducive to ensemble playing. The results have implication for networked musical performance. Network delay is a function of transmission distance and/or internetworking (routing) delays. The findings suggest that sensitive ensemble performance can be supported over rather long paths (e.g., San Francisco to Denver at about 20ms, one-way). The finding that moderate amounts of delay are beneficial to tempo stability seems, at first glance, counterintuitive. We discuss the observed effect.},

abstract = {Internet-based collaborative networking applica-tions, such as instant messaging, voice-over-IP telephony, and social networking, have displaced traditional communication services and redefined social interaction. The Internet has also trans-formed the music industry, revolutionizing the way music is distributed and marketed. Yet despite these two powerful trends, the intersection—where collaboration and music meet in online music-making—has remained merely a curiosity. Why? Artistically pleasing online audio collaboration requires network delay less than that encountered typically in the Internet. The bandwidth required for high-quality audio exceeds the bandwidth that is generally available on consumer-oriented broad-band access (cable and digital subscriber line [DSL]) systems. The emergence of Web 2.0, broadly defined as Web-based communities such as social-networking sites that facilitate sharing of ideas among Web users, has been significant for many existing online communities. One such community, made up of real-time Web-based music collaborators using sys-tems for networked musical performance (NMP), is in its infancy. An online NMP application lets musicians from across the globe play together over the Internet, as if they were together in a studio. With online music-making (either improvisatory or strictly notated), musicians can create ensembles without location bounds, searching for musicians around the world. The quality of the user's experi-ence is critical to the success of this Web application. However, because performing artists are highly sen-sitive to delay, network latency affects the quality of the user experience of online music-making. To achieve a good user experience the latency over the network has to be within reasonable bounds. If the delay is excessive, then the musicians will not be Computer Music Journal, 35:1, pp. 76–89, Spring 2011 c 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. able to maintain a consistent tempo. We seek to find out how the tempo of two musicians performing together via a network varies as a function of fixed network delay. Future work may consider the more general case of more than two musicians and/or variable network delay. Two musicians making music online will inde-pendently generate rhythmic patterns. Entrainment refers to an interaction between autonomous rhyth-mic processes such that they adjust to a common tempo or related tempi. Two oscillators, like two rhythmic processes, may synchronize, but other phase relationships are also possible. Entrainment and synchronization arise in many different con-texts, where there is interaction (or coupling) between oscillators, where the oscillator may be designed for a particular purpose (e. g., electronic oscillator), or occur naturally (e. g., neural oscilla-tors). Mathematical models of electronic and neural oscillators have been developed and are used to predict behavior by analysis or simulation. We are particularly interested in models for coupled oscillators with a time delay between them. One such model was developed for geographically separated oscillators with delay compensation (an-ticipation). An equivalent model was developed for mutual entrainment of two limit-cycle oscillators with time-delayed coupling. We will show that both models make the same prediction: For delays that are a small fraction of the tempo period, the mean tempo in beats per minute (BPM), or beats per second, decreases by approximately half the tempo times the delay in seconds. This result is also relevant when musicians are far apart on a stage (e. g., the opposite ends of an opera stage), as each meter of separation adds about 3 msec of delay. This article is organized as follows. We begin with a review of previous work on network musical performance systems and musical collaboration at a distance with delay. We also review previous work on entrainment and coupled oscillators. We develop 76 Computer Music Journal},

abstract = {Routers in the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) architecture maintain state for all pending content requests, so as to be able to later return the corresponding content. By employing stateful forwarding, CCN supports native multicast, enhances security and enables adaptive forwarding, at the cost of excessive forwarding state that raises scalability concerns. We propose a semi-stateless forwarding scheme in which, instead of tracking each request at every on-path router, requests are tracked at every d hops. At intermediate hops, requests gather reverse path information, which is later used to deliver responses between routers using Bloom filter-based stateless forwarding. Our approach effectively reduces forwarding state, while preserving the advantages of CCN forwarding. Evaluation results over realistic ISP topologies show that our approach reduces forwarding state by 54{\%}-70{\%} in unicast delivery, without any bandwidth penalties, while in multicast delivery it reduces forwarding state by 34{\%}-55{\%} at the expense of 6{\%}-13{\%} in bandwidth overhead.},

abstract = {Wireless technology is growing increasingly prevalent in the development of new interfaces for live music performance. However, with a number of different wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band, there is a high risk of interference and congestion, which has the potential to severely disrupt live performances. With its high transmission power, channel bandwidth and throughput, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) presents an opportunity for highly robust wireless communications. This paper presents our preliminary work optimising the components of a Wi-Fi system for live performance scenarios. We summarise the manufacture and testing of a prototype directional antenna that is designed to maximise sensitivity to a performer's signal while suppressing interference from elsewhere. We also propose a set of recommended Wi-Fi configurations to reduce latency and increase throughput. Practical investigations utilising these arrangements demonstrate a single x-OSC device achieving a latency of {\textless}3 ms and a distributed network of 15 devices achieving a net throughput of {\~{}}4800 packets per second ({\~{}}320 per device); where each packet is a 104-byte OSC message containing 16 analogue input channels acquired by the device.},

abstract = {A variety of short time delays inserted between pairs of subjects were found to affect their ability to synchronize a musical task. The subjects performed a clapping rhythm together from separate sound-isolated rooms via headphones and without visual contact. One-way time delays between pairs were manipulated electronically in the range of 3 to 78 ms. We are interested in quantifying the envelope of time delay within which two individuals produce synchronous performances. The results indicate that there are distinct regimes of mutually coupled behavior, and that 'natural time delay'--delay within the narrow range associated with travel times across spatial arrangements of groups and ensembles--supports the most stable performance. Conditions outside of this envelope, with time delays both below and above it, create characteristic interaction dynamics in the mutually coupled actions of the duo. Trials at extremely short delays (corresponding to unnaturally close proximity) had a tendency to accelerate from anticipation. Synchronization lagged at longer delays (larger than usual physical distances) and produced an increasingly severe deceleration and then deterioration of performed rhythms. The study has implications for music collaboration over the Internet and suggests that stable rhythmic performance can be achieved by 'wired ensembles' across distances of thousands of kilometers.},

abstract = {Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) are musical instruments typically composed of a control surface where user interaction is measured by sensors whose values are mapped to sound synthesis algorithms. These instruments have gained interest among skilled musicians and performers in the last decades leading to artistic practices including musical performance, interactive installations and dance. The creation of DMIs typically involves several areas, among them: arts, design and engineering. The balance between these areas is an essential task in DMI design so that the resulting instruments are aesthetically appealing, robust, and allow responsive, accurate and repeatable sensing. In this paper, we review the use of sensors in the DMI community as manifested in the proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 2009–2013). Focusing on the sensor technologies and signal conditioning techniques used by the NIME community. Although it has been claimed that specifications for artistic tools are harder than those for military applications, this study raises a paradox showing that in most of the cases, DMIs are based on a few basic sensors types and unsophisticated engineering solutions, not taking advantage of more advanced sensing, instrumentation and signal processing techniques that could dramatically improve their response. We aim to raise awareness of limitations of any engineering solution and to assert the benefits of advanced electronics instrumentation design in DMIs. For this, we propose the use of specialized sensors such as strain gages, advanced conditioning circuits and signal processing tools such as sensor fusion. We believe that careful electronic instrumentation design may lead to more responsive instruments.},
