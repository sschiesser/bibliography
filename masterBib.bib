@article{Chen:2008,
	Abstract = {Acousticians have long debated whether and how the resonances of the vocal tract are involved in the playing of clarinet and saxophone. We measured the resonances of saxophonists' vocal tracts directly while they played. Over most of the instrument's range, there is no simple relation between tract resonances and the note played, and the tract resonances varied among players. In the high (altissimo) range, a strong resonance of the tracts of professional saxophonists was systematically tuned slightly above the desired note. Amateurs, who did not tune a strong resonance, were unable to play notes in the altissimo range.},

A validated tool to mea- sure this unique experience would be beneficial for the de- sign process of new digitalmusical instruments. Experimen- tal applications could also reveal a deeper understanding of musical interaction itself. By embracing an exploratory ap- proach, this research aims to find the relevant dimensions of this construct and to validate them by using established statistical methods. With completion of the planned work, the contribution to the NIME-community will be a ques- tionnaire to investigate the musician's playing experience in musical interaction. This short paper gives a brief overview of the relevant dimensions by looking at user experience re- search and previous domain specific studies. The planned procedure towards the development ofmeasuringmusician's playing experience is briefly described.},

No such phenomenon in terms of the amplitude has been reported for the tactile modality. In this study naive observers were presented with pink noise vibrations enveloped in a Gabor wavelet. Characteristic durations ranging between 0.1 and 0.7 s and intensities ranging from 0.3 and 3.0 10â3 m/s 2 were presented to the fingertip. Using a two alternative forced choice staircase procedure, the points of subjective equivalence were estimated for the 0.4 s long reference stimulus. Similarly to vision and audition, lower intensities were consistently reported for shorter stimuli. The observed relationship could be interpreted as reflecting a mechanism of haptic constancy with respect to exploration speed.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an experiment on the relative contri- butions of haptic and auditory information to bimodal judgments of contact stiffness using a rigid probe. Haptic feedback is rendered via a PhantomR physically-based audiomodel of impact, in which the colliding objects are described as modal resonators that interact through a non-linear impact force. The impact force can be controlled through a stiffness parameter, that influences the contact time of the impact. Previous studies have already indicated that this parameter has a major influence on the au- ditory perception of hardness/stiffness. In the experiment subjects had to tap on virtual surfaces, and were presented with audio-haptic feed- back. In each condition the haptic stiffness had the same value while the acoustic stiffness was varied. Perceived stiffness was determined us- ing an absolute magnitude-estimation procedure: subjects were asked to rate the surfaces on an ordered scale of verbal labels, based on their per- ceived stiffness. The results indicate that subjects consistently ranked the surfaces according to the auditory stimuli. î OmniTM device, while auditory stimuli are obtained using a},

@book{SIDBook,
	Abstract = {Sound is an integral part of every user experience but a neglected medium in design disciplines. Design of an artifact's sonic qualities is often limited to the shaping of functional, representational, and signaling roles of sound. The interdisciplinary field of sonic interaction design (SID) challenges these prevalent approaches by considering sound as an active medium that can enable novel sensory and social experiences through interactive technologies. This book offers an overview of the emerging SID research, discussing theories, methods, and practices, with a focus on the multisensory aspects of sonic experience. "Sonic Interaction Design" gathers contributions from scholars, artists, and designers working at the intersections of fields ranging from electronic music to cognitive science. They offer both theoretical considerations of key themes and case studies of products and systems created for such contexts as mobile music, sensorimotor learning, rehabilitation, and gaming. The goal is not only to extend the existing research and pedagogical approaches to SID but also to foster domains of practice for sound designers, architects, interaction designers, media artists, product designers, and urban planners. Taken together, the chapters provide a foundation for a still-emerging field, affording a new generation of designers a fresh perspective on interactive sound as a situated and multisensory experience.Contributors: Federico Avanzini, Gerold Baier, Stephen Barrass, Olivier Bau, Karin Bijsterveld, Roberto Bresin, Stephen Brewster, Jeremy Coopersotck, Amalia De Gotzen, Stefano Delle Monache, Cumhur Erkut, George Essl, Karmen Franinovi, Bruno L.

@article{VanDoren1990,
	Abstract = {The ability of subjects to detect temporal gaps between bursts of sinusoids or bursts of bandlimited noise was measured to evaluate the phenomenon of tactile ``sensory persistence'' in older persons. Vibratory stimuli were delivered to the right thenar eminence of 27 subjects ranging in age from 8--75 years. The subjects' task was to detect the presence of a silent interval or ``gap'' between flanking 350âms vibrotactile stimuli. The gapâdetection threshold, expressed as the amplitude of vibration relative to the absolute detection threshold, decreased as the gap duration increased and was higher for gaps in noise than for gaps in sinusoids. The threshold for detecting short gaps increased with age for noise stimuli, but not for sinusoidal stimuli. Furthermore, the gapâdetection threshold recovered more rapidly in older subjects for noise stimuli, but less rapidly in older subjects for sinusoidal stimuli. Because of these differences, it appears that the effects of age on gap detection cannot be due to a simple increase in sensory persistence, but may be due to multiple processes.},

This paper describes these parameters and methods of obtain- ing them for a violin sound. The objective parameters are violin modes with their properties: frequency and mutual energy factor. The subjective parameter is evalu- ation of sound quality done by experts. Based on violin modes parameters, expert judgements and harmony perception, a sound quality classifier was created. The es- timated value of sound quality evaluation is consistent with expert judgements for 75.5\% of instruments from AMATI multimedia database containing recordings of violins from 10th InternationalHenrykWieniawski Violin Maker Competition.},

	Abstract = {Materials for the vehicle interior are of specific interest to the customer. They are not only needed to fulfil technical functions, but are in direct focus of the customer's perception. The perceived quality is a function of all sensory data collected by the human perceptual system: Surfaces express design intent and craftsmanship by their visual appearance. Haptic features supervene when materials are touched. And even smell has an influence on the perception of ambience. Although sound is generated nearly every time when fingers slide across the surface, touch sounds have been disregarded so far. In order to address this issue, a method has been developed for standardized generation of touch sounds. It includes simulation of realistic finger force, touch area and sliding velocity. Sounds generated on typical flat specimen of steering wheel materials have been recorded. Sounds were played back to participants under exclusive auditory conditions. The influence of psycho-physical parameters and iconic sound features on perceived quality has been investigated. Furthermore, the interaction of sound sensation with visual and haptic features could be studied. Results demonstrate that the sound excited by fingers sliding across a surface contains essential information about the nature and the quality of materials applied. As an example, the auditory roughness can modify the perceived haptic roughness of a surface. A consequent consideration of surface touch sounds enables choice of materials with maximized multi-sensory harmony.},

	Abstract = {In R \& D departments of companies, the evaluation of sounds usually is based on physical measurements. However, in "real life", the ultimate judge for sounds is the human hearing system. A customer evaluates the sound of a product by his or her hearing system, not by physical measurement tools, whatever their sophistication may be. In this situation, psychoacoustics is the scientific field of choice to bridge the gap between physical and subjective evaluations. In psychoacoustic experiments, firm relations between the physical representations of sounds and the correlated hearing sensations are established. In practical applications of psychoacoustics, two main tasks can be distinguished: First, questions of sound evaluation, usually for already existing sounds which often have to be improved and Second, questions of sound quality engineering, where for a (new or modified) product or application a suitable sound has to be "tailored". For the evaluation of sounds, basic psychoacoustic magnitudes like loudness and sharpness have proven successful, which assess volume or power and tone color of sounds, respectively. Using these descriptors, extremely different questions like the quality of piano sounds or the annoyance of snoring sounds can be assessed. In addition, psychoacoustic magnitudes related to the temporal structure of sounds like fluctuation strength or roughness can play an important part. In sound quality engineering, for each sound, the right "recipe" has to be found, how to mix the different hearing sensations, to arrive at the desired sound. For the example of warning signals, a systematic approach, incorporating elements of decision tree studies, is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Studied the effect of removing auditory feedback on keyboard performance by focusing specifically on parameters of expression in piano performance: horizontal and vertical timing, horizontal and vertical dynamics, and pedaling. Six pianists (the \%A and young musicians with professional piano training) performed a short musical excerpt from a Chopin etude 10 times on a digital piano in each of 4 conditions: expressive or metronomic, with and without feedback. The data analyses revealed significant effects of feedback deprivation on all expressive parameters in both expressive and metronomic performance. However, these effects were very small, except for some substantial changes in pedaling by some pianists. To determine the perceptual and aesthetic significance of these effects, a group of 10 (undergraduate) pianist listeners was presented with a forced-choice test in which expressive performances produced with and without feedback were paired. The listeners correctly identified the performance played without feedback on only 63.5\% of the trials, which confirms the relative subtlety of the effects of feedback deprivation.

	Abstract = {Dexterous use of the hand represents a sophisticated sensorimotor function. In behaviors such as playing the piano, it can involve strong temporal and spatial constraints. The purpose of this study was to determine fundamental patterns of covariation of motion across joints and digits of the human hand. Joint motion was recorded while 5 expert pianists played 30 excerpts from musical pieces, which featured â¼50 different tone sequences and fingering. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis using an expectation-maximization algorithm revealed that joint velocities could be categorized into several patterns, which help to simplify the description of the movements of the multiple degrees of freedom of the hand. For the thumb keystroke, two distinct patterns of joint movement covariation emerged and they depended on the spatiotemporal patterns of the task. For example, the thumb-under maneuver was clearly separated into two clusters based on the direction of hand translation along the keyboard. While the pattern of the thumb joint velocities differed between these clusters, the motions at the metacarpo-phalangeal and proximal-phalangeal joints of the four fingers were more consistent. For a keystroke executed with one of the fingers, there were three distinct patterns of joint rotations, across which motion at the striking finger was fairly consistent, but motion of the other fingers was more variable. Furthermore, the amount of movement spillover of the striking finger to the adjacent fingers was small irrespective of the finger used for the keystroke. These findings describe an unparalleled amount of independent motion of the fingers.},

@article{Furuya2010,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of auditory feedback derived from one keystroke in the control of the rhythmicity and velocity of successive keystrokes during piano playing. We examined the effects of transient auditory perturbations with respect to the pitch, loudness, and timing of one tone on subsequent keystrokes while six pianists played short excerpts from three simple musical pieces having different tempi ("event rates"). Immediately after a delay in tone production, the inter-keystroke interval became shorter. This compensatory action depended on the tempo, being most prominent at the medium tempo. This indicates that temporal information provided by auditory feedback is utilized to regulate the timing of movement elements produced in a sequence. We also found that the keystroke velocity changed after the timing, pitch, or loudness of a tone was altered, although the response differed depending on the type of perturbation. While delaying the timing or altering the pitch led to an increase in the velocity, altering the loudness changed the velocity in an inconsistent manner. Furthermore, perturbing a tone elicited by the right hand also affected the rhythmicity and velocity of keystrokes with the left hand, indicating that bimanual coordination of tone production was maintained. Finally, altering the pitch sometimes resulted in striking an incorrect key, mostly in the slow piece, emphasizing the importance of pitch information for accurate planning and execution of sequential piano keystrokes.},

	Abstract = {Performances of memorized piano compositions unfold via dynamic integrations of motor, perceptual, cognitive, and emotive operations. The functional neuroanatomy of such elaborately skilled achievements was characterized in the present study by using (15)0-water positron emission tomography to image blindfolded pianists performing a concerto by J.S. Bach. The resulting brain activity was referenced to that for bimanual performance of memorized major scales. Scales and concerto performances both activated primary motor cortex, corresponding somatosensory areas, inferior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, motor cingulate, bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex, right thalamus, anterior and posterior cerebellum. Regions specifically supporting the concerto performance included superior and middle temporal cortex, planum polare, thalamus, basal ganglia, posterior cerebellum, dorsolateral premotor cortex, right insula, right supplementary motor area, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Areas specifically implicated in generating and playing scales were posterior cingulate, middle temporal, right middle frontal, and right precuneus cortices, with lesser increases in right hemispheric superior temporal, temporoparietal, fusiform, precuneus, and prefrontal cortices, along with left inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, much greater deactivations were present for playing the concerto than scales. This seems to reflect a deeper attentional focus in which tonically active orienting and evaluative processes, among others, are suspended. This inference is supported by observed deactivations in posterior cingulate, parahippocampus, precuneus, prefrontal, middle temporal, and posterior cerebellar cortices. For each of the foregoing analyses, a distributed set of interacting localized functions is outlined for future test.},

A large amount of single piano tones were played with two prototypical types of touch: depressing the keys with the finger initially resting on the key surface (pressed), and hitting the keys from a certain distance above (struck). Musicians were asked to identify the type of touch of the recorded samples, in a first block with all attack noises before the tone onsets included, in a second block without them. Half of the listeners could correctly identify significantly more tones than chance in the first block (up to 86\% accuracy), but no one in block 2. Those who heard no difference tended to give struck ratings for louder tones in both blocks.},

Vibration at a frequency of 300 cpm and an amplitude of 6 mm, or at a frequency of 1000 cpm and an amplitude of 3 mm, were applied until the subject could no longer tolerate them (a 20 min period) by a noise-controlled vibration exciter. There was no significant change in threshold sensitivity after exposure to vibration alone. Exposure to vibration and noise simultaneously caused greater threshold shifts (TTS) and longer recovery time than exposure to noise alone. This was especially true with 1000 cpm vibration. It was suggested that the effects of the combined noise and vibration might be the results of some disturbances of physiological homeostasis or possible mechanical interactions with its blood supply.

	Abstract = {Thresholds for the detection of vibrotactile signals of varied duration applied to the thenar eminence were measured in the absence of and in the presence of a masking stimulus. Signals were 250â and 500âHz sinusoids and noise bursts with bandwidth limited to 250--1000 Hz. The masking stimulus was either a 250âHz sinusoid, which was presented in phase with the signal when it was sinusoidal, or noise. Changes in threshold as a function of changes in signal duration were found which were predicted accurately from Zwislocki's theory [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 32, 1046--1060 (1960)] of temporal summation when the signal was detected by the Pacinian channel, but not when it was detected by a nonâPacinian channel (NP). However, when either the signal or the masking stimulus or both were noise, NP thresholds were affected by changes in signal duration. Only when the signal and masking stimuli were both sinusoids were NP thresholds independent of signal duration. It is concluded that signal duration effects in the NP channel are not due to temporal integration, but rather to increases in information about the signal content provided to the subject as exposure duration is increased.},

	Abstract = {The overall goal of the research presented here is to better understand how players evaluate different qualities of the vi- olin. To this end, we investigated intra- and inter-individual consistency in preference judgements by experienced vi- olinists. Results from two previous studies that involved free-playing evaluative tasks showed that players are self- consistent in their preference for violins and tend to agree of what particular qualities they look for in an instrument (in this case, ``richness'' and ``dynamic range''). However, the perception of the same attributes widely varies across individuals, thus likely resulting in large inter-individual differences in the preference for violins. A third study was conducted to further investigate the perceptual eval- uation of richness and dynamic range in constrained- vs. unconstrained-playing tasks. Results indicated that specify- ing the musical material and technique removes a significant amount of inter-individual variability: the more focused the task, the more self-consistent violinists are and the more they agree with each other.},

This paper presents a novel coupling of haptics technology and music, introducing the notion of tactile composition or aesthetic composition for the sense of touch. A system that facilitates the composition and percep- tion of intricate, musically structured spatio-temporal pat- terns of vibration on the surface of the body is described. Relevant work from disciplines including sensory substi- tution, electronic musical instrument design, simulation design, entertainment technology, and visual music is con- sidered. The psychophysical parameter space for our sense of touch is summarized and the building blocks of a compo- sitional language for touch are explored. A series of concerts held for the skin and ears is described, as well as some of the lessons learned along the way. In conclusion, some potential evolutionary branches of tactile composition are posited.},

	Abstract = {The peripheral mechanoreceptive system in the skin consists of several functional components: the mechanical response of the skin, the mechanical response of the end organ, the creation of the generator potential, the initiation of an action potential, and (for some units) the branching structure of the afferent fibers. Experimentally, only the stimulus applied to the surface of the skin and the final afferent nerve fiber response (as the signal propagates toward the central nervous system) can be measured. The system must therefore be treated as a series of black boxes for which we only have access to the first input and the last output. Previous research has focused on one or another of these boxes and related them to the final output, despite the fact that the components act together to produce the response and cannot be treated in isolation. Here we examine the system as a whole, with the goal of attributing different aspects of the final nerve fiber response to the various components of the system. Our approach is to determine the components which are necessary and sufficient to describe this overall system response.},

	Abstract = {Almost two centuries of continuous scientific inves- tigation make the violin the most studied string instrument by far, and probably the most studied of all musical instruments. The vibrational com- plexity of the violin, where interior air modes vie with corpus and vibro-acoustically coupled modes to produce the actual sound, is entangled with the transformation of vibrational energy into acoustic energy to produce sound. To date no quantitative technique has been successful in reliably de- scribing or predicting the overall quality of the violin. Con- sequently as experimental techniques have evolved, scien- tific research has also. The current technology can now offer automation, low-damping support fixtures to separate out radiation damping, zero-mass-loading excitation and re- sponse, and simultaneous modal and acoustical analysis on the violin.},

	Abstract = {Vacuum cleaners are widely used household appliances and they usually generate quite unpleasant sound. The four most common sources of vacuum cleaner noise are the motor, the fan, the airflow and the surface vibrations. Connections between the motor and such vibrating surfaces of a vacuum cleaner allow very efficient transmission of the force and the motion, which are then transformed to sound. The surface velocity, the sound pressure and the acoustic power of the vibrating surfaces are very important parameters in the noise control and source location problems. The purpose of this study is to asses the vibro-acoustical characteristics of a sample wet and dry type vacuum cleaner and to determine the acoustic power radiated from this type of vacuum cleaner. For this purpose, the near-field sound pressure, the surface velocity and the sound intensity levels are measured. By using these measurements, the sound intensity, the near-field sound pressure and the surface velocity mappings are generated and using these measurements, the sound intensity compares the results compared to find the effects of the vibrating surfaces on the total vacuum cleaner sound power level.

@article{Okamoto2011c,
	Abstract = {The perception of the mass and viscosity of an object is based on the dynamic forces applied to our hands when we jiggle or lift the object [1], [2], [3]. This force is commonly assumed to be sensed by kinetic receptors [4] in our muscles or tendons. When jiggling objects, we also experience the cutaneous deformation of our finger pads. In this study, we show that the dynamic vibration on the finger pad influences our perception of mass and viscosity. We experimentally confirm that the vibration on the finger pad, that synchronizes with the hand's accelerations or velocities, enhances the perceived changes in the mass or viscosity when the vibrotactile stimuli and the changes in the mass and viscosity are in the same perceptual direction. For example, when the increased mass and an acceleration-synchronized tactile stimulus\&\#x02014;which is a positive bias for the mass\&\#x02014;are simultaneously presented to the experiment participants, they respond that the perceived increase in the mass is enhanced. In contrast, when the tactile and proprioceptive stimuli are in perceptually opposite directions, the vibrotactile stimuli cancel the perceived changes in the mass and viscosity. In particular, the effect of the velocity-synchronized vibration on perception is stronger than the effect of the actual viscosity.},

	Abstract = {In the psychophysical literature describing the relationships between physical and psychological magnitudes, as physical intensity increases, perceived intensity often grows much faster near threshold than at higher levels. In this laboratory, however, the loudness curve for sinusoidal vibrotactile stimuli was best fit by a single-limbed function rather than by the expected two-limbed function. In the present study, we measured the growth of vibrotactile loudness of 250-Hz sinusoidal stimuli by the method of absolute magnitude estimation to explore the source of the one- versus two-limbed discrepancy. The number of times that the stimulus was presented was varied, as well as whether the stimulator contacted the skin with constant force or constant penetration. Neither of these manipulations affected the shape of the loudness function consistently. Number of repetitions influenced the shapes of the magnitude estimation functions, but only for a few individuals. Skin-contactor coupling did not affect the shapes of the functions, although the absolute level (vibrotactile loudness) was consistently greater for constant indentation.},

@article{Yau2010,
	Abstract = {A major goal in perceptual neuroscience is to understand how signals from different sensory modalities are combined to produce stable and coherent representations. We previously investigated interactions between audition and touch, motivated by the fact that both modalities are sensitive to environmental oscillations. In our earlier study, we characterized the effect of auditory distractors on tactile frequency and intensity perception. Here, we describe the converse experiments examining the effect of tactile distractors on auditory processing. Because the two studies employ the same psychophysical paradigm, we combined their results for a comprehensive view of how auditory and tactile signals interact and how these interactions depend on the perceptual task. Together, our results show that temporal frequency representations are perceptually linked regardless of the attended modality. In contrast, audio-tactile loudness interactions depend on the attended modality: Tactile distractors influence judgments of auditory intensity, but judgments of tactile intensity are impervious to auditory distraction. Lastly, we show that audio-tactile loudness interactions depend critically on stimulus timing, while pitch interactions do not. These results reveal that auditory and tactile inputs are combined differently depending on the perceptual task. That distinct rules govern the integration of auditory and tactile signals in pitch and loudness perception implies that the two are mediated by separate neural mechanisms. These findings underscore the complexity and specificity of multisensory interactions.},

	Abstract = {Pressure, motion, and gesture are important parameters in musical instrument playing. Pressure sensing allows to in- terpret complex hidden forces, which appear during playing a musical instrument. The combination of our new sensor setup with pattern recognition techniques like the lately de- veloped ordered means models allows fast and precise recog- nition of highly skilled playing techniques. This includes left and right hand analysis as well as a combination of both. In this paper we show bow position recognition for string in- struments by means of support vector regression machines on the right hand finger pressure, as well as bowing recog- nition and inaccurate playing detection with ordered means models. We also introduce a new left hand and chin pressure sensing method for coordination and position change anal- ysis. Our methods in combination with our audio, video, and gesture recording software can be used for teaching and exercising. Especially studies of complex movements and finger force distribution changes can benefit from such an approach. Practical applications include the recognition of inaccuracy, cramping, or malposition, and, last but not least, the development of augmented instruments and new playing techniques.},

@article{Provancher2009,
	Abstract = {This research focuses on the relative importance of fingerpad skin stretch on the perception of friction. It is hypothesized that the perceived magnitude of friction rendered by traditional force feedback can be increased through the addition of fingertip skin stretch. Perceptual data are presented from two separate tests performed on nine male subjects. The first experiment determines the perceptual thresholds for friction based on a modified Karnopp friction model where friction is rendered as purely a kinesthetic resistance via a PHANToM force feedback device. JNDs of 0.056-50.150 corresponding to static coefficients for friction of mus = 0.2-0.8 were established. The second experiment evaluates possible changes in the perceived friction magnitude due to imposing small amounts of tangential skin stretch (0.25-0.75 mm) to the fingerpad in combination with force feedback (kinesthetic resistance). Our results show that even these small amounts of skin stretch lead to a statistically significant increase in perceived friction (p < 0.01). This significant finding will enable the hapticians to more realistically and accurately render friction via a combination of kinesthetic resistance and tactile feedback.},

Reference stimuli are placed near the absolute perception threshold of these frequencies, therefore very high discrimination thresholds of 20 dB on average (with a runaway value of 40 dB @ 1000 Hz) are measured. This is in accordance to observations of Weber's Law for reference stimuli near the perception threshold. Sta- tistical analysis suggests influence of fingertip size on the results, but no influence of fine motor activity (i.e. playing musical instruments, handi- craft, computer games) could be asserted with the given dataset.

@article{LamoreKeemink:VibesThreshForce,
	Abstract = {The shape of the psychophysical frequency threshold curve for vibrations presented to the skin in the frequency region 5-1000 Hz is strongly dependent on the static force that the vibrator exerts on the skin and on whether there is a rigid surround around the vibrating contactor (presence of contrast). Where there is no rigid surround, an increase in static force reduces the threshold in the high-frequency region and increases it at low frequencies. When the static forces are sufficiently large, the thresholds reach a minimum value above 30 Hz and a maximum one below 30 Hz, this being the crossover frequency. Under these conditions in the frequency region around 200 Hz, where the threshold is determined by the Pacini receptor system, the vibration sensitivities of finger pad and thenar eminence (glabrous skin) are equal, while the value for the inner side of the forearm (hairy skin) is 12 dB higher. However, when a rigid surround is used, the threshold increases above 30 Hz and decreases below 30 Hz. The latter increase in sensitivity, which is introduced by the presence of contrast cues, amounts to about 20 dB and is sharply tuned at 18 Hz for the glabrous skin of the finger. It is argued that in this case the threshold is determined by the Meissner receptor system. This increase in sensitivity is less pronounced (about 10 dB) and less sharply tuned for the other sites. Finally, when the contact of the vibrating surface to the skin is at a minimum, the vibration threshold has the same displacement value (about 3 microns) over the whole frequency region independent of the site of stimulation and whether or not a rigid surround is present.},

	Abstract = {Three experiments investigated whether force and torque cues interact in haptic discrimination of force, torque, and stiffness, and if so, how. The statistical relation between force and torque was manipulated across four experimental conditions: either one type of cue varied while the other was constant, or both varied so as to be positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated. Experiment 1 showed that the subjects' ability to discriminate force was improved by positively correlated torque but impaired with uncorrelated torque, as compared to the constant torque condition. Corresponding effects were found in Experiment 2 for the influence of force on torque discrimination. These findings indicate that force and torque are integrated in perception, rather than being processed as separate dimensions. A further experiment demonstrated facilitation of stiffness discrimination by correlated force and torque, whether the correlation was positive or negative. The findings suggest new means of augmenting haptic feedback to facilitate perception of the properties of soft objects.},

@inproceedings{VanErp2002,
	Abstract = {Vibro-tactile displays convey messages by presenting vibration to the user's skin. In recent years, the interest in and application of vibro-tactile displays is growing. Vibratory displays are introduced in mobile devices, desktop applications and even in aircraft [1]. Despite the growing interest, guidelines on the design of vibro-tactile displays are still lacking. Existing guidelines are mainly concerned with passive displays, such as Braille labels on controls, nibs on keyboards and notches on smart cards [2, 3, 4]. In this paper we focus on active displays, either consisting of a single vibrating element (used in for example mobile phones and computer mice) or numerous elements (used in for example active Braille displays and body suits [5, 6]). This paper discusses a first set of guidelines, dealing with the basic vibro-tactile parameters. The set is mainly derived from neurophysiological and psychophysical data. The guidelines indicate the relevant parameters as well as possible pitfalls. As such they can serve as a point of departure for interface designers. Important expansions of the set can come from user evaluation studies and examples of best practices.},

	Abstract = {The vibration levels in four traditional stringed instruments during playing have been investigated, including the double bass, violin, guitar, and the piano. The vibration levels, which were measured at several positions and at different dynamic levels, were evaluated with respect to reported thresholds for detection of vibrotactile stimuli. The results show that the vibration levels are well above threshold for almost all positions on the instruments in normal playing. It is concluded that the perceived vibrations may be of some assistance with regard to intonation in ensemble playing, in particular for the bass instruments. The finger forces exerted when playing the bowed strings, as well as the touch forces in piano playing were studied briefly. It was concluded that the kinesthetic forces perceived in playing may assist the timing in performance.},

Specifically, we explain the relevant human vibrotactile perceptual capabilities, detail the main types of commercial vibrotactile actuators, and describe how to build both monolithic and localized vibrotactile displays. We then identify exemplary vibrotactile display systems in application areas ranging from the presentation of physical object properties to broadcasting vibrotactile media content.},

Together they provide a general introduction to haptic interfaces, their construction, and application design. Haptic interfaces comprise hardware and software components aiming at providing computer-controlled, programmable sensations of mechanical nature, i.e., pertaining to the sense of touch. In Part I, we describe methods that have been researched and developed to date to achieve the generation of haptic sensations, the means to construct experimental devices of modest complexity, and the software components needed to drive them. In Part II of this series, we will describe some basic concepts of haptic interaction design together with several interesting applications based on this technology.},

@article{Lederman1987a,
	Abstract = {Two experiments establish links between desired knowledge about objects and hand movements during haptic object exploration. Experiment 1 used a match-to-sample task, in which blindfolded subjects were directed to match objects on a particular dimension (e.g., texture). Hand movements during object exploration were reliably classified as ``exploratory procedures,'' each procedure defined by its invariant and typical properties. The movement profile, i.e., the distribution of exploratory procedures, was directly related to the desired object knowledge that was required for the match. Experiment 2 addressed the reasons for the specific links between exploratory procedures and knowledge goals. Hand movements were constrained, and performance on various matching tasks was assessed. The procedures were considered in terms of their necessity, sufficiency, and optimality of performance for each task. The results establish that in free exploration, a procedure is generally used to acquire information about an object property, not because it is merely sufficient, but because it is optimal or even necessary. Hand movements can serve as ``windows,'' through which it is possible to learn about the underlying representation of objects in memory and the processes by which such representations are derived and utilized.},

	Abstract = {Haptic devices allow the production of virtual textured surfaces for psychophysical experiments. Some studies have shown inconsistencies between virtual and real textures with respect to their psychophysical functions for roughness, leading to speculation that virtual textures differ in some way from real ones. We have determined the psychophysical function for roughness using textures rendered with a high-fidelity magnetic levitation haptic device. A constraint surface algorithm was used to simulate the motion of a spherical probe over trapezoidal gratings and randomly dithered cones. The shape of the psychophysical functions for roughness is consistent between subjects but varies with changes in texture and probe geometry. For dithered cones, inverted ``U''-shaped functions were found nearly identical, in maxima and curvature, to those in the literature for real textures with similar geometry.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates perceptive characteristics properties of human skin spatiotemporal and and tactile considers biomechanical their implications for the design of tactile displays. Three separate experiments were conducted. First, we measured vibrotactile thresholds as a function of frequency of vibration, using a cylindrical contactor of 0.7mm diameter. The results of our experiment showed similar trends to that of previous physiological results that used a larger contactor. In the second experiment, vibrotactile spatial acuities were investigated. Two- point localization errors were measured on the tip of the index finger and on thenar eminence as a function of frequency of vibration. The results show that human skin is sensitive to spatial differences at the frequency bands of 1-3Hz and 18-32Hz. The subjects' spatial acuities gradually decreased as the frequency of vibration increased over 50Hz. In the third experiment, impedances function of frequency of vibration. From these results, we discuss the of human skin were measured as a implications in the designing of spatially distributed tactile displays and methods for texture display.},

Methods: Vibrotactile thresholds were measured on 12 healthy men by three different psychophysical methods. All measurements were performed with the same vibrometer in which the vibratory stimulus was applied by a probe 6 mm in diameter that protruded through a hole of 10 mm diameter in a surround, controlling both the contact force and the push force. Four stimulus frequencies (16, 31.5, 63 and 125 Hz) were used to obtain responses from FAI and FAII mechanoreceptors.},

@article{HaradaGriffin1991,
	Abstract = {The effects of various conditions, including temporary threshold shifts (TTS) induced by exposure to vibration on vibration sense thresholds, have been investigated. The vibration sense thresholds of five subjects were measured on the middle fingertip of the left hand. A contactor with a diameter of 7 mm was surrounded by three alternative plates with holes of different sizes. The contact force was controlled at either 1 N, 2 N, or 3 N. For the TTS test, the left hand was exposed to vibration at 20 ms-2 rms for five minutes. The frequencies of both the exposure to vibration and the vibration threshold test were in the range 16 Hz to 500 Hz. Using a surround around the contactor greatly reduced the vibration sense threshold at 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz but increased the threshold at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz. An effect of contact force was seen only at the higher frequencies; larger contact forces led to lower thresholds at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz. As temperature of the finger skin decreased, the vibration thresholds increased, with the changes at higher frequencies greater than those at lower frequencies. The TTS at 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz measured 0.5 minutes after exposure to vibration (TTS0.5) were highest after exposures to vibration at lower frequencies. The TTS0.5 at 63 Hz was similar after exposure to all frequencies. The TTS0.5 values at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz were highest after exposures to vibration at 125 Hz and 250 Hz. It was apparent that the physiological characteristics of vibration sensation at low and high frequencies differed significantly. These findings suggest that two representative frequencies can be used when evaluation the neurological effects of occupational exposures to vibration by means of vibration sense thresholds.},

@article{HowardRimell:phModMusicTactile,
	Abstract = {Electronic sound synthesis continues to offer huge potential possibilities for the creation of new musical instruments. The traditional approach is, however, seriously limited in that it incorporates only auditory feedback and it will typically make use of a sound synthesis model (e.g., additive, subtractive, wavetable, and sampling) that is inherently limited and very often nonintuitive to the musician. In a direct attempt to challenge these issues, this paper describes a system that provides tactile as well as acoustic feedback, with real-time synthesis that invokes a more intuitive response from players since it is based upon mass-spring physical modelling. Virtual instruments are set up via a graphical user interface in terms of the physical properties of basic well-understood sounding objects such as strings, membranes, and solids. These can be interconnected to form complex integrated structures. Acoustic excitation can be applied at any point mass via virtual bowing, plucking, striking, specified waveform, or from any external sound source. Virtual microphones can be placed at any point masses to deliver the acoustic output. These aspects of the instrument are described along with the nature of the resulting acoustic output.},

@article{Gu2013a,
	Abstract = {Thresholds for the perception of vibration on the hand reduce with increasing area of excitation when the thresholds are mediated by the Pacinian channel (a phenomenon known as spatial summation) but thresholds are generally independent of the area of excitation when they are mediated by non-Pacinian channels. The effect of the area of excitation on vibrotactile thresholds at the sole of the foot has not been thoroughly investigated. In the study reported in this paper, thresholds for the perception of 20Hz vibration and 160Hz vibration were determined on the foot (at the big toe (hallux), the medial (inside) ball, the lateral (outside) ball, and the heel) and on the hand (at the thenar eminence and at the fingertip) in 12 male subjects using four probe diameters: 1mm (0.19cm2 excitation area), 3mm (0.38cm2), 6mm (0.78mm2) and 10mm (1.53cm2) with a 2mm gap between the vibrating probe and a fixed surround. On both the hand and the foot, thresholds for the perception of 160Hz vibration decreased as the probe diameter increased. There was no overall consistent change in thresholds for the perception of 20Hz vibration. Thresholds for the perception of 160Hz vibration were lowest at the fingertip and highest at the big toe. Thresholds for 20Hz vibration were also lowest at the fingertip. It is concluded that on the sole of the foot there is evidence of spatial summation in the perception of 160Hz vibration, mediated by the Pacinian channel, but not in the perception of 20Hz vibration, mediated by a non-Pacinian channel. The findings show that vibrotactile thresholds at the foot obtained with different areas of excitation, or an unknown area of excitation, should not be compared. It is concluded that there is a need to standardise methods of measuring the vibrotactile thresholds at the foot that are obtained for clinical applications. {\copyright} 2013 IPEM.},

	Abstract = {Expert performance is commonly accompanied by a subjective state of optimal experience called flow. Previous research has shown positive correlations between flow and quality of performance and suggests that flow may function as a reward signal that promotes practice. Here, piano playing was used as a flow-inducing behavior in order to analyze the relationship between subjective flow reports and psychophysiological measures. Professional classical pianists were asked to play a musical piece and then rate state flow. The performance was repeated five times in order to induce a variation in flow, keeping other factors constant, while recording the arterial pulse pressure waveform, respiration, head movements, and activity from the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major facial muscles. A significant relation was found between flow and heart period, blood pressure, heart rate variability, activity of the zygomaticus major muscle, and respiratory depth. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of emotion, attention, and expertise, and flow is proposed to be a state of effortless attention, which arises through an interaction between positive affect and high attention.},

All combinations of three feedback modes are analysed: non-speech audio, tactile, and pseudo-haptic `sticky' feedback. The tactile conditions used stimulation through vibration (rather than force-feedback), and the sticky conditions were implemented by dynamically reconfiguring mouse control-display gain as the cursor entered the target. Results show that for small, discretely located targets all feedback modes reduce targeting times, with stickiness providing substantial improvements. Furthermore, stickiness and tactile appear to combine well. However, the results of a more ecologically-oriented menu-selection task show the need for caution, revealing that excessive feedback can damage interaction though `noise' that interferes with the acquisition of neighbouring targets.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports on the results of an experiment involving a wearable sensorimotor enhancer intended to improve tactile sensitivity in human fingertips. As briefly exposing tactile receptors to subsensory vibration is known to enhance tactile sensitivity thanks to a phenomenon called stochastic resonance in the somatosensory system, applying white-noise vibration to a fingertip is expected to improve the sense of touch and associated motor skills. Against such a background, a prototype of a wearable device called a sensorimotor enhancer is proposed here. The device is attached to the radial side of the fingertip and stimulates tactile receptors by applying vibration from a lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric stack actuator. This design keeps the palmar region free, thereby helping to maintain the wearer's manipulative ability. Sensory and motor tests involving 11 human subjects were conducted to determine the efficacy of the device, and the results confirmed its usefulness.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In healthy people, the vibrotactile perception threshold (VPT) at fingertips depends on a given measurement method and on individual characteristics such as age, gender and finger skin temperature. The aim of the study was to compare the VPT values in 2 groups of healthy subjects with different finger skin temperature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 56 males and 76 females, who formed pairs matched with respect to age, gender and body mass index (BMI) but differing in terms of finger skin temperature at pre-launch testing. The finger skin temperature of less than 29$\,^{\circ}$C indicated the subjects with "cold hands" and that of more than 29$\,^{\circ}$C, the subjects with "warm hands". The measuring system made use of P8 pallesthesiometer (EMSON-MAT, Poland) and the measurement procedure was in compliance with the ISO 13091-1:2001 standard. VPT measurements were performed for the index, middle and ring fingers of both hands at the frequencies of 4 Hz, 25 Hz, 31.5 Hz, 63 Hz, 125 Hz and 250 Hz. RESULTS: The findings of the study revealed that the mean VPTs among the subjects with "cold hands" were significantly higher than the corresponding values among the subjects with "warm hands". CONCLUSIONS: The type of individual peripheral thermoregulation should be considered when assessing the VPT and determining its reference values.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamic, distributed pressure response of the human fingerpad in vivo when it first makes contact with an object. A flat probe was indented against the fingerpad at a 20 to 40 degree angle. Ramp-and-hold and sinusoidal displacement trajectories were applied to the fingerpad within a force range of 0-2 N. The dynamic spatial distribution of the pressure response was measured using a tactile array sensor. Both the local pressure variation and the total force exhibited nonlinear stiffness (exponential with displacement) and significant temporal relaxation. The shape of the contact pressure distribution could plausibly be described by an inverted paraboloid. A model based on the contact of a rigid plane (the object) and a linear viscoelastic sphere (the fingerpad), modified to include a nonlinear modulus of elasticity, can account for the principal features of the distributed pressure response.},

	Abstract = {Finger force, acceleration and position are fundamental in playing music instruments. Measuring these parameters is a technical challenge and precise position and acceleration measurement of single fingers is particularly demanding. We present a sensor setup for multi modal measurements of force, position and acceleration in piano playing. We capture outputs from the upper extremity contributing to the total force output seen at the fingers. To precisely char- acterize fingers' positions and acceleration we use wear- able sensors. A 6-axes (3-force and 3-torque axes) force sensor precisely captures contributions from hand, wrist and arm. A finger's acceleration sensor and a MIDI grand piano complete the measuring setup. The acceleration and position sensor is fixed to the dorsal aspect of the last fin- ger phalanx. The 6-axes sensor is adjustable to fit individ- ual hand positions and constitutes a basis setup that can be easily expanded to account for diverse measurement needs. An existing software tool was adapted to visualize the sen- sor data and to synchronize it to the MIDI out. With this basis setup we seek to estimate the isolated force output of finger effectors and to show coherences of finger position, force and attack. To proof the setup, a few pilot measure- ments were carried out.},

The main question was whether finger motion dynamics change with performance tempo, an important issue for practicing and training. Kinematic landmarks determined from the finger trajectories changed considerably as the tempo became faster; piano touch was under deliberate control only at slow tempi. Individual differences in performance speed led to specific claims about desirable finger dynamics for successful piano playing.},

	Abstract = {Research has suggested that perception and action are independent (see M. A. Goodale \& A. Haffenden, 1998). The authors used the Ebbinghaus illusion to test this hypothesis in 2 experiments. Verbal reports of perceived size were compared with maximum grip aperture during grasping (Experiment 1) and manual reports of perceived size (Experiment 2). A multidimensional signal detection analysis was used to distinguish among the possible interactions between the two processes in each experiment (H. Kadlec \& J. T. Townsend, 1992a, 1992b). In Experiment 1, the percepts were independent, and there were no interactions between processes for verbal and visuomotor responses. In Experiment 2, the percepts associated with verbal and manual reports were independent, but the processes interacted at the levels of the stimulus information and the decision rules used to transform each percept into a response.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigated how auditory and vibrotactile feedback information is integrated within the context of violin quality evaluation. Fifteen violinists evaluated three violins on four criteria-"Rich Sound," "Loud and Powerful," "Alive and Responsive," and "Pleasure"-during a perceptual experiment. Violinists first evaluated the violins one at a time under three experimental conditions: (1) playing, (2) listening to it (played by a professional player) in an active way by fingering the score on an isolated neck, (3) same as (2) with vibrotactile feedback provided at the isolated neck. Violinists were then asked to evaluate the violins through pairwise comparisons under condition (3): Each violin was paired with itself while the level of vibrations of the isolated neck was either the original one or divided by two. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that Loud and Powerful judgments were affected by the presence of vibrations given that violins were rated louder in condition (3) than in (2). In the second part, violins were rated more positively with original vibration level at the isolated neck than with half the level, for all criteria but Alive and Responsive. Consistently with sensory interaction, the magnitude of the enhancement remained relatively constant across violins.},

It reviews where active touching helps, by setting forth the forms it may take and important parameters that describe it; and evaluates the specific benefits it offers to contemporary interface problems. It ends with a proposal for a simple interaction model that emphasizes holistic design principles, and highlights issues that arise in the process of creating specific haptic interfaces},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a full-body vibrotactile display that can be used as a tool to help learning music performance. The system is composed of 10 vibrotactile actuators placed on different positions of the body as well as an extended and modified version of a software tool for generating tactile events, the Fast Afferent/Slow Afferent (FA/SA) application. We carried out initial tests of the system in the context of enhancing the learning process of novice guitar players. In these tests we asked the performers to play the guitar part over a drum and bass-line base track, either heard or felt by the performers through headphones and the tactile display they were wearing. Results show that it is possible to accurately render the representation of the audio track in the tactile channel only, therefore reducing the cognitive load in the auditory channel.},

@article{Therrien2010,
	Abstract = {While much is known about sequential effects in motor timing, less is understood about whether movement parameters such as force show sequential dependencies. In this study, we examined the effect of timing constraints on repetitive unimanual force production sequences. Ten healthy participants produced a series of pinch grip forces in time to a metronome and to visually specified force amplitudes. Either visual feedback of force produced or the auditory metronome removed 10 s into the experimental trial, with participants performing continued responses for the remaining 20 s. In the continuation trials, a negative lag-1 autocorrelation in the inter-response intervals (IRIs) was observed as is commonly seen in motor timing tasks. However, removal of visual feedback resulted in a systematic increase in mean force output through the course of the trial, resulting in positive lag-1 autocorrelation values. An interaction was found between mean IRI and peak force (PF) magnitude, with greater force variability seen for the larger intervals. However, the imposition of dual force and timing constraints had no effect either on the underlying variability of the PF or on the IRIs. The results are discussed in the context of force and time being independently specified components of a generalized motor program.},

@article{Singh2010,
	Abstract = {We studied the effects of fatigue of the index finger on indices of force variability in discrete and rhythmic accurate force production tasks performed by the index finger and by all four fingers pressing in parallel. An increase in the variance of the force produced by the fatigued index finger was expected. We hypothesized that the other fingers would also show increased variance of their forces, which would be accompanied by co-variation among the finger forces resulting in relatively preserved accuracy of performance. The subjects performed isometric tasks including maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and accurate force production before and after a 1-min MVC fatiguing exercise by the index finger. During fatigue, there was a significant increase in the root mean square index of force variability during accurate force production by the index finger. In the four-finger tasks, the variance of the individual finger force increased for all four fingers, while the total force variance showed only a modest change. We quantified two components of variance in the space of hypothetical commands to fingers, finger modes. There was a large increase in the variance component that did not affect total force and a much smaller increase in the component that did. The results suggest an adaptive increase in force variance by nonfatigued elements as a strategy to attenuate effects of fatigue on accuracy of multi-element performance. These effects were unlikely to originate at the level of synchronization of motor units across muscle compartments but rather involved higher control levels.},

	Abstract = {The effect of fatigue on finger force perception within a hand during ipsilateral finger force matching was examined. Thirteen subjects were instructed to match a reference force of an instructed finger using the same or different finger within the hand before and after index finger fatigue. Absolute reference force targets for the index or little finger were identical during pre- and post-fatigue sessions. Fatigue was induced by a 60-s sustained maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the index finger. Index finger MVC decreased approximately 29\%, while there was a non-significant (about 5\%) decrease in the little finger MVC. The results showed that: (1) the absolute reference and matching forces of the instructed fingers were not significantly changed after fatigue, while the total forces (sum of instructed and uninstructed finger forces) were increased after fatigue. (2) The relative forces (with respect to corresponding pre- and post-fatigue MVCs) of the index finger increased significantly in both reference and matching tasks, while the relative forces of the little finger remained unchanged after fatigue. (3) Matching errors remained unchanged after fatigue when the fatigued index finger produced the reference force, while the errors increased significantly when the fatigued index finger produced the matching force. (4) Enslaving (difference between total and instructed finger forces) increased significantly after fatigue, especially during force production by the fatigued index finger and when the little finger produced matching forces at higher force levels. (5) Enslaving significantly increased matching errors particularly after fatigue. Taken together, our results suggest that absolute finger forces within the hand are perceived within the CNS during ipsilateral finger force matching. Perception of absolute forces of the fatigued index finger is not altered after fatigue. The ability of the fatigued index finger to reproduce little finger forces is impaired to a certain degree, however. The impairment is likely to be attributable to altered afferent/efferent relationships of the fatigued index finger.},

	Abstract = {We studied the effects of fatigue, induced by a 60-s maximal isometric force production with the index finger, on multi-finger coordination and force production by the other fingers of the hand. Finger forces were measured during single- and multi-finger maximal voluntary force production (MVC) at two sites, the middle of the distal or the middle of the proximal phalanges. Two fatiguing exercises involving force production by the index finger were used, one at the distal phalanx and the other at the proximal phalanx. The MVC of the index finger dropped by about 33\% when it was produced at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise. In addition, large transfer effects of fatigue were observed across sites of force application and across fingers. Force deficit increased under fatigue, especially due to a drop in the recruitment of the index finger. Under fatigue, the index finger was less enslaved during force production by other fingers. During multi-finger tasks, the percentage of total force produced by the index finger was significantly reduced after the fatiguing exercise. The principle of minimization of secondary moments was violated under fatigue. We suggest that the most impaired (fatigued) finger shows less interaction with other fingers or, in other words, is being progressively removed from the multi-finger synergy. Some of the observed changes in finger coordination suggest effects of fatigue at a central (neural) level.},

	Abstract = {1. This study investigated the effects of fatigue, induced by production of maximal isometric force for 60 s with four fingers, upon indices of multifinger co-ordination. 2. Measurements of individual finger forces were performed during single- and multifinger maximal force production (maximal voluntary contraction, MVC) for two sites of force application, the middle of the distal or the middle of the proximal phalanxes. Two fatiguing exercises were used, involving force production at the distal phalanxes and at the proximal phalanxes. Fourteen subjects were tested. 3. The total force in four-finger tasks dropped by about 43 \% when it was produced at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise. During force production at the other site, MVC dropped by 23 \%. During single-finger MVC tests, force drop with fatigue was similar across all four fingers (about -25 \% of their corresponding MVCs). 4. Force production by one finger was accompanied by involuntary force production by other fingers (enslaving). Enslaving remained unchanged by fatigue when measured during force generation at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise, but increased during force production at the other site. 5. The total MVC of four fingers acting in parallel was smaller than the sum of the MVCs of these fingers in single-finger tasks (force deficit). The force deficit increased with fatigue. Force-sharing patterns during four-finger tasks showed only minor changes under fatigue. 6. These results indicate that the effects of fatigue were not limited to changes in the force-generating capabilities of the muscles. In particular, fatigue could lead to a reorganisation at a neural level that defines commands to individual fingers.},

	Abstract = {Both timbre and dynamics of isolated piano tones are determined exclusively by the speed with which the hammer hits the strings. This physical view has been challenged by pianists who emphasize the importance of the way the keyboard is touched. This article presents empirical evidence from two perception experiments showing that touch-dependent sound components make sounds with identical hammer velocities but produced with different touch forms clearly distinguishable. The first experiment focused on finger-key sounds: musicians could identify pressed and struck touches. When the finger-key sounds were removed from the sounds, the effect vanished, suggesting that these sounds were the primary identification cue. The second experiment looked at key-keyframe sounds that occur when the key reaches key-bottom. Key-bottom impact was identified from key motion measured by a computer-controlled piano. Musicians were able to discriminate between piano tones that contain a key-bottom sound from those that do not. However, this effect might be attributable to sounds associated with the mechanical components of the piano action. In addition to the demonstrated acoustical effects of different touch forms, visual and tactile modalities may play important roles during piano performance that influence the production and perception of musical expression on the piano.},

The difference between the energy required for a single vibrator, in dB, to reach threshold and the energy required for two vibrators presented successively to reach threshold was taken as the measure of probability summation. Spatial summation was computed as the difference between the energies required for threshold for the two vibrators presented successively and simultaneously. Both probability summation, 0.52 dB lowering in threshold, and spatial summation, 1.94 dB lowering in threshold, remained constant as a function of the distance between the two vibrators on the thigh. Similaramounts of summation were obtained unilaterally and bilaterally on the fingers. When the frequency of vibration was lowered to 9 Hz, no spatialsummation wasfound. When the frequencies ofvibration at the two test sites were different, 160 Hz at one locus, 360 Hz at the other locus, there was no spatialsummation.},

In order to create realistic vibrotactile feedback, we collected vibrations, forces, and velocities during various tasks executed with a stylus: tapping on materials, stroking textures, and puncturing membranes. Empirical models were fit to these waveforms and a library of model parameters was compiled. These models simulated tasks involving simultaneous display of forces and vibrations on a high-bandwidth force-feedback joystick. Vibration feedback adds little complexity to virtual environment algorithms. Human subjects interacting with the system showed improved execution and perception when performing surface feature discrimination tasks.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the question of strength perception for vibration signals used in mobile devices. Employing devices similar to standard cell phones and using pulsed vibration signals to combat adaptation effects, experiments were performed to study the effect of weight and underlying vibration frequency on perceived strength. Results shows that for the same measured acceleration on the device, a heavier box is perceived to vibrate with greater strength. Furthermore, signals with higher underlying frequency are perceived to be weaker for the same measured acceleration. While our results are consistent with previous studies, they are obtained for the specific condition of ungrounded, vibrating objects held in the hand. Our results suggest the need for a systematic correction law for use by designers to specify the vibratory characteristics of a device as a function of its weight and of the desired operating frequency.},

However, those platforms typically target everyday programmers rather than composers and media artists. On the other hand, tangible user interface (TUI) toolkits, which provide an integrated, easy-to-use solution have not gained momentum in modern music creation. We propose a concept that hybridizes physical computing and TUI toolkit approaches. This helps to tackle typical TUI toolkit weaknesses, namely quick sensor obsolescence and limited choices. We developed a physical realization based on the idea of "universal pins," which can be configured to perform a variety of duties, making it possible to connect different sensor breakouts and modules. We evaluated our prototype by making performance measurements and conducting a user study demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.},

	Abstract = {In order to better understand how violinists evaluate violin quality, playing and listening tests were conducted. Three French professional violinists assessed three violins with different qualities. The assessment was conducted orally, with violinists answering open questions regarding the quality of each violin while playing it and then while listening to it played live by somebody else. The violinists were further asked to rank these violins in order of preference. The oral reports were transcribed and linguistically analysed. It first allowed us to identify the linguistic resources in French available to speakers to account for their experience, in particular to describe what appeared as two different entities: the violin and its sound. Secondly, a semantic analysis of the discourses showed that these resources were shared by the participants but were used differently to qualify each violin in the two experiments. In particular, the analysis revealed aspects, like the ``ease of playing" or the ``projection", which were used frequently in the playing test but very little in the listening test. This can be explained by the fact that, in the listening test, the evaluation is made by relying on the sound only and, therefore, this evaluation is mainly based on the resultant sound without any possible comparison nor control on the nature of the sound and the manner by which it was produced. However such processes of comparison and control on the instrument when producing the sound are essential for the evaluation of the quality of a violin by violinists, as proved by the agency given to the violin in the assessments given during the playing task and the players' statements regarding what is a ``good" or a ``bad" violin.},

	Abstract = {In R \& D departments of companies, the evaluation of sounds usually is based on physical measurements. However, in "real life", the ultimate judge for sounds is the human hearing system. A customer evaluates the sound of a product by his or her hearing system, not by physical measurement tools, whatever their sophistication may be. In this situation, psychoacoustics is the scientific field of choice to bridge the gap between physical and subjective evaluations. In psychoacoustic experiments, firm relations between the physical representations of sounds and the correlated hearing sensations are established. In practical applications of psychoacoustics, two main tasks can be distinguished: First, questions of sound evaluation, usually for already existing sounds which often have to be improved and Second, questions of sound quality engineering, where for a (new or modified) product or application a suitable sound has to be "tailored". For the evaluation of sounds, basic psychoacoustic magnitudes like loudness and sharpness have proven successful, which assess volume or power and tone color of sounds, respectively. Using these descriptors, extremely different questions like the quality of piano sounds or the annoyance of snoring sounds can be assessed. In addition, psychoacoustic magnitudes related to the temporal structure of sounds like fluctuation strength or roughness can play an important part. In sound quality engineering, for each sound, the right "recipe" has to be found, how to mix the different hearing sensations, to arrive at the desired sound. For the example of warning signals, a systematic approach, incorporating elements of decision tree studies, is discussed.},

The qualities of a violin depend upon a number of different, often subtle factors. Most of them are mechanical-acoustical, referring to the way the instrument vibrates and radiates sound. However, there are other, perceptual factors that relate to the way the player ``feels'' the instrument. The overall goal of this study is to better understand how violinists perceptually assess violins. This is a critical aspect of violin acoustics that has only recently been considered essential in developing an understanding of what distinguishes one instrument from another.

@phdthesis{Saitis2014,
	Abstract = {This thesis addresses the perceptual evaluation of violins from the player perspective. Three carefully controlled violin-playing studies were carried out, wherein experienced musicians assessed violins of different make and age, and described their choices in open-ended questionnaires. The focus was gradually narrowed from examining overall preference (Study 1) to the evaluation of certain perceptual attributes of the violin (Studies 2 and 3). Two distinct yet complementary approaches were followed: a systematic investigation into the reliability of preference judgments, and an exploratory analysis of concepts emerging from impromptu preference verbalizations.Study 1 examined both intra- and inter-player consistency in repetitive violin preference rankings. It was found that violinists are self-consistent when evaluating different instruments but a significant lack of agreement between musicians was observed. Study 2 investigated the origin of inter-individual differences and measured the extent to which different attributes of the instrument influence preference. Results showed that whereas violinists tend to agree of what particular qualities they look for in an instrument---preference was strongly associated with sound richness and, to a lesser extent, dynamic range---the perception of the same attributes widely varies across individuals. Study 3 focused on the evaluation of richness and dynamic range in constrained (playing only certain notes on certain registers) vs. unconstrained (playing a certain excerpt from the classical repertoire) tasks. The perception of richness from playing vs. listening tasks (using recorded sounds from the playing task) was also examined. Results suggested that specifying the musical material and technique removes a significant amount of inter-player variability: the more focused the task, the more self-consistent violinists are and the more they agree with each other. From verbal responses collected in the first and second studies, a categorization scheme emerged that illustrates the complex links between the different player-typical concepts (e.g., response, clarity, balance), properties (e.g., ease, richness, projection), and underlying themes (handling, sound and their relevance to the individual). A psycholinguistic analysis of the quality-relevant lexicon showed a diversity of linguistic devices borrowed mainly from four semantic fields (perceptual dimensions) related to texture-temperature (smooth vs. rough), action-presence (resonant vs. muted), size-volume (deep vs. flat) and light (dark vs. bright). Richness, associated with the perceived amount of low-to-mid harmonics in the sound, was identified as a key perceptual factor in evaluating violin quality.},

	Abstract = {A taxonomy of haptic modes is proposed as a basis for evaluating haptic interfaces. Haptic modes are defined as distinct styles of using haptic perception for purposeful activity. An evaluation method that exercises a single haptic mode tests the hardware and software of the interface on a task that has a clear relationship to actual applications. To demonstrate this approach to evaluation, the mode of geometric perception was evaluated for a point force device. Twelve observers performed a shape recognition task using a PHANToM display. The task proved difficult, with a mean recognition time of 22 s. This class of devices does not appear to support adequate performance for applications that require geometric perception. The paper concludes with possible extensions to both the shape recognition protocol and the taxonomy of modes},

	Abstract = {The development and evaluation of haptic rendering algorithms presents two unique challenges. Firstly, the haptic information channel is fundamentally bidirectional, so the output of a haptic environment is fundamentally dependent on user input, which is difficult to reliably reproduce. Additionally, it is difficult to compare haptic results to real-world, ``gold standard'' results, since such a comparison requires applying identical inputs to real and virtual objects and measuring the resulting forces, which requires hardware that is not widely available. We have addressed these challenges by building and releasing several sets of position and force information, collected by physically scanning a set of real-world objects, along with virtual models of those objects. We demonstrate novel applications of this data set for the development, debugging, optimization, evaluation, and comparison of haptic rendering algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Since haptics technology is being increasingly used in computer games, surgical simulators, rehabilitation therapy, mobile phones etc., there is a need for defining standards for haptic applications. Our study aims at meeting this need by establishing a norm for evaluation of haptic interfaces and by identifying significant benchmark metrics. Towards this end, we have proposed a combined physical and psychophysical experimental methodology. First, the physical performance measures and device characterization techniques were investigated. Testing conditions were described in an illustrative way to obtain a tutorial-like guideline for device characterization. The physical characterization methods were demonstrated on a novel haptic interface for surgical simulation which has been developed in our lab. Second, a wide range of human psychophysical experiments were reviewed. We have unified the psychophysical experiments as a systematic evaluation method which results in novel benchmark metrics for haptic interfaces. Experimental user studies were carried out with three commercial force-feedback devices. The metrics reveal their basic characteristics which are not easily derived from the given specifications. Applicability of the tests to a tactile feedback device was also investigated. The holistic methodology proposed in this work provides objective evaluation criteria allowing users to compare different haptic devices quantitatively, as well as a better understanding of how the limitations of such devices may influence the results of studies involving interaction with humans.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present a study we conducted to assess physical and perceptual properties of a tactile display for a tactile notification system within the CIRMMT Live Elec- tronics Framework (CLEF), a Max-based 1 modular envi- ronment for composition and performance of live electronic music. Our tactile display is composed of two rotating ec- centric mass actuators driven by a PWM signal generated from an Arduino microcontroller. We conducted physical measurements using an accelerometer and two user-based studies in order to evaluate: intensity and spectral peak fre- quency as function of duty cycle, as well as perceptual vi- brotactile absolute and differential threshold. Results, ob- tained through the use of a logit regression model, provide us with precise design guidelines. These guidelines will enable us to ensure robust perceptual discrimination be- tween vibrotactile stimuli at different intensities. Among with other characterizations presented in this study, these guidelines will allow us to better design tactile cues for our notification system for live-electronics performance.},

	Abstract = {Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs) .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging. One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.},

	Abstract = {The maturation process of the NIME field has brought a growing interest in teaching the design and implementa- tion of Digital Music Instruments (DMI) as well as in find- ing objective evaluation methods to assess the suitability of these outcomes. In this paper we propose a methodology for teaching NIME design and a set of tools meant to inform the design process. This approach has been applied in a master course focused on the exploration of expressiveness and on the role of the mapping component in the NIME cre- ation chain, through hands-on and self-reflective approach based on a restrictive setup consisting of smart-phones and the Pd programming language. Working Groups were formed, and a 2-step DMI design process was applied, including 2 performance stages. The evaluation tools assessed both System and Performance as- pects of each project, according to Listeners' impressions after each performance. Listeners' previous music knowl- edge was also considered. Through this methodology, stu- dents with different backgrounds were able to effectively engage in the NIME design processes, developing working DMI prototypes according to the demanded requirements; the assessment tools proved to be consistent for evaluating NIMEs systems and performances, and the fact of inform- ing the design processes with the outcome of the evaluation, showed a traceable progress in the students outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Recordings from single peripheral nerve fibres made it possible to analyse the functional properties of tactile afferent units supplying the glabrous skin of the human hand and to assess directly the relation between impulse discharge and perceptive experiences. The 17,000 tactile units in this skin area of the human hand are of four different types: two fast adapting types, FA I and FA II (formerly RA and PC), and two slowly adapting types, SA I and SA II. The receptive field characteristics and the densities in the skin of the type I units (FA I and SA I) indicate that these account for the detailed spatial resolution that is of paramount importance for the motor skill and the explorative role of the hand. The relationship between the stimulus amplitude and perceived intensity during sustained skin indentations did not match the corresponding stimulus response functions of SA units suggesting non-linear transformations within the central nervous system. These transformations, in turn, appear to vary between subjects. A single impulse in a single FA I unit may be felt when originating from the most important tactile regions of the hand, indicating that the psychophysical detection may be set by the threshold of the sense organs. Moreover, no significant noise seems to be superimposed in the respective central sensory pathways.},

@article{Winter2008,
	Abstract = {Tactile stimulation usually occurs as a combination of an active movement (reaching out to touch a surface) and a sensation (actually feeling the surface against the skin). The brain has information about the active component (the motor command) before it occurs because of efference copy, while the passive component must be transduced before it can be processed. Since the active and passive tactile components are available to the brain at different times, determining the time of touch requires calculation worked backwards from the passive sensation, and/or worked forward from the active motor command. In order to determine which touch process is perceived more quickly, we varied the relative delay between an active and a passive touch signal and determined the relative time percieved as simultaneous. A passive touch needed to be presented before an active key was pressed in order for the two touches to be perceived as simultaneous, but this timing difference was not significant. In order to test the plasticity of the active and passive touch systems, we exploited the fact that the point of subjective simultaneity between two stimuli can sometimes be altered by repeated exposure to asynchronous presentation. We exposed subjects to an active key press/ passive touch pair delayed by 250 ms. This exposure increased the range of relative delays between active and passive touches at which the pairs were judged as simultaneous. This is consistent with an adaptive change in the processing of active touch. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Haptic technology, providing force cues and creating a programmable interface, can assist users in more accurately using an interface. This paper investigates haptic assistance in combination with auditory feedback instead of visual feedback. A user test is carried out in which participants select fundamental frequencies from a continuous range to play brief musical melodies. Two control conditions are compared with two detent-based haptic assistance conditions. The detents gently guide the users toward locations of equal tempered fundamental frequencies. Results from the user test confirm improved accuracy brought about by the detents. It is further helpful to provide regulation of the strength of haptic assistance in real time, allowing the user to remain always in control. This concept motivated the force-sensitive detent condition, which enables the user to adjust the strength of the haptic assistance in real time by changing the downward force applied to the haptic device. The work implies that users of graphical user interfaces could similarly benefit from force-sensitive detents and more generally real-time regulation of the strength of haptic assistance.},

	Abstract = {Background. A musical instrument is a device for producing musical tones. Therefore engineers traditionally associate the quality of the musical instrument with the quality of the tones it produces. In turn, the quality of the tone is determined by its acoustical parameters. In this deterministic logic, it is quite possible to judge the quality of the instrument by the parameters of its tones, provided the relations between them are known. From an engineering point of view the playing comfort and tone quality of a musical instrument are usually assigned to different design units of a musical instrument (e.g. key action vs. sound unit in pianos), For this reason, instrument designers like to have expert musicians' judgments of an instrument separated in acoustical and mechanical qualities. Aims. We want to show, that this separation is not reliable under normal playing conditions due to psychological reasons. Practical ways of avoiding the problem are discussed. Main contribution. Our experimental data suggest that the performer's impression of the quality of a musical instrument received simultaneously over the auditory and kinesthetic sensory channels are not additive. Cross-modal interference is a plausible explanation to why musicians confuse these impressions. Multimodal perception of a musical instrument by the performer and listener, respectively, is analyzed. Implications. 1) Improving procedures of quality assessment in musical instrument industry; 2) Solving, on a psychological level, the classical controversy between musicians and physicists of touch dependence of a piano tone.},

	Abstract = {We are interested in estimating whether the harder skin affects the frequency response to vibration sensitivity or not. While there is the difference among individuals, it is well known that the threshold to vibration sensitivity as a function of frequency yields a U-shaped curve that reaches a maximum of sensitivity in the region of 250 Hz as shown in Fig.1. By focusing on this fact, we can evaluate which the vibration sensitivity is changed under the normal condition and the harder skin conditions caused by pressing the proximal phalange of finger forcibly. Through measuring the vibration sensitivity by the psychophysical method, we found that the vibration sensitivity at the frequency of 80 Hz and 120 Hz improves with the statistical significance test (p-value) of below 10 \%, but no effect was showed at the frequency of 10 Hz and 30 Hz.},

The sponge itself is described, but the main focus is on the evolution of the mapping strategies that are used. The author reviews the guidelines proposed by other researchers and explains how they were concretely applied with the sponge. He concludes that no single strategy constitutes a solution to the issue of mapping and that musical compositions are complex entities that require the use of a multitude of mapping strategies in parallel. It is hoped that the mappings described combined with new strategies will eventually lead to the emergence of a musical language that is idiomatic to the sponge.},

@misc{Orio2002,
	Abstract = {The widespread availability of high-performance, affordable personal computers has brought a new wealth of possibilities regarding real-time control of musical parameters. In fact, real-time gestural control of computer music has become a major trend in recent years (e.g., Wanderley and Battier 2000). Various input devices for musical expression--- also called hardware interfaces, control surfaces,or (gestural) controllers---have been proposed (Penny- cook 1985; Roads 1996; Paradiso 1997; Mulder 1998; Bongers 2000, Cook 2001; Piringer 2001). These devices can be roughly classified into several categories: instrument-like controllers that try to emulate the control interfaces of existing acoustic instruments; instrument-inspired controllers that are basically designed loosely following the charac- teristics of existing instruments (but that do not necessarily seek an emulation of their counter- parts); extended instruments, that is, acoustic in- struments augmented by the use of several sensors; and alternate controllers, whose designs do not fol- low that of any existing instrument. A more careful examination reveals two main trends behind these categories: the tendency to de- sign controllers to best fit some already developed motor control ability (the case of the first three categories), or an attempt to deliberately avoid any relationship to gestural vocabularies associated to existing instruments, therefore allowing the use of different movements and postures not traditionally used in music performance.},

In this essay, I argue that one of the most significant of these problems is the way in which conventional computer interfaces preclude embodied modes of interaction. I examine the theoretical and technological foundations of this ``disconnect'' between performer and instrument, and sketch an outline for the design of embodied or ``enactive'' digital instruments. My research builds on recent work in human-computer interaction and ``soft'' artificial intelligence, and is informed by the phenomenology of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, as well as the ``enactive cognitive science'' of Francisco Varela and others. I examine the ways in which the conventional metaphors of computer science and ``hard'' artificial intelligence derive from a mechanistic model of human reasoning, and I outline how this model has informed the design of interfaces that inevitably lead to disembodied actional modes. I propose an alternative model of interaction that draws on various threads from the work of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and the enactive cognitive scientists. The ``enactive model of interaction'' that I propose is concerned with circular chains of embodied interdependency between performer and instrument, instrumental ``resistance'' to human action and intentionality, and an integrative approach to the roles of sensing, acting and cognitive process in the incremental acquisition of performative skill.},

	Abstract = {There is a longstanding disconnect between mechanical models of the piano, in which key velocity is the sole determinant of each note's sound, and the subjective experience of trained pianists, who take a nuanced, multidimensional approach to physical gestures at the keyboard (commonly known as ``touch''). We seek to peel back the abstraction of the key press as a discrete event, developing models of key touch that link qualitative musical intention to quantitative key motion. The interaction between performer and instrument (whether acoustic or electronic) can be considered a special case of human-machine interaction, and one that takes place on far different terms than ordinary human-computer interaction: a player's physical gestures are often the result of intuitive, subconscious processes. Our proposed models will therefore aid the development of computer interfaces which connect with human users on an intuitive, expressive level, with applications within and beyond the musical domain. 7.1},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the process of appropriation in digital musical instrument performance, examining the effect of instrument complexity on the emergence of personal playing styles. Ten musicians of varying background were given a deliberately constrained musical instrument, a wooden cube containing a touch/force sensor, speaker and embedded computer. Each cube was identical in construction, but half the instruments were configured for two degrees of freedom while the other half allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video, sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive effect of reducing the exploration of the instrument's affordances; this suggested the presence of a dominant constraint in one of the two configurations which strongly differentiated the process of appropriation across the two groups of participants.},

	Abstract = {Recent years have seen a significant increase of interest in rich multi-modal user interfaces going beyond conventional mouse/keyboard/screen interaction. The new interface technologies are broadly impacting music technology and culture. New musical interfaces use a variety of sensing (and actuating) modalities to receive and present information to users, and often require techniques from signal processing and machine learning in order to extract and fuse high level information from noisy, high dimensional signals over time. Hence they pose many interesting signal processing challenges while offering fascinating possibilities for new research. At the same time the richness of possibilities for new forms of musical interaction requires a new approach to the design of musical technologies and has implications for performance aesthetics and music pedagogy. This tutorial begins with a general and gentle introduction to the theory and practice of the design of new technologies for musical creation and performance. It continues with an overview of signal processing and machine learning methods which are needed for more advanced work in new musical interface design.},

	Abstract = {The trend towards the virtual in music synthesis has lead to the inevitable decline of the physical, effectively inserting a `veil of tactile paralysis' between the musician and the sound source. Cymatic is a new computer based musical instrument which attempts to reverse this tendency by allowing users to interact with virtual instruments via tactile and gestural interfaces. Utilising a mass/spring physical modelling paradigm, Cymatic models multi-dimensional, interconnectable resonating structures that can be played in real-time with various excitation methods. Gestural control as well as tactile and proprioceptive feedback is provided via a force feedback joystick and a tactile feedback mouse, restoring the musician's sense of working with a true physical instrument in the natural world.},

MINUET aims to provide new perspectives on the design of musical interfaces, referred to as a general term that comprises digital musical instruments and interactive installations. The ultimate purpose is to reduce the complexity of the design space emphasizing the experience of the player. MINUET is structured as a design process consisting of two stages: goal and specifications. The reliability of MINUET is tested through a systematic comparison with the related work and through a case study. To this end, we present the design and prototyping of Hexagon, a new musical interface with learning purposes.},

A holistic approach is taken, considering the role of new instru- ments in electronic music, as well as the concept of touch in culture and experience. Research about the human biological systems that enable vibrotactile perception is reviewed, with a special focus on its relevance to music. Out of this review, an approach to vibration synthesis is developed that integrates the current understand- ing of human vibrotactile perception. An account of musical vibrotactile interaction design is presented, which includes the implementation of a vibrotactile feedback synthesizer and the construction of two hardware prototypes that display musical vibration.},

Building on previous work developing a DMI with integrated vibrotactile feedback actuators, we discuss how to produce instrument-like vibrations, compare these simulated vibrations with those produced by an acoustic instrument and examine how the integration of this feedback effects performer ratings of the instrument. We found that integrated vibrotactile feedback resulted in an increase in performer engagement with the instrument, but resulted in a reduction in the perceived control of the instrument. We discuss these results and their implications for the design of new digital musical instruments.},

A survey of current software solutions for creating haptic virtual environments is provided, with a discussion on the need to integrate such a platform with currently accepted solutions for audio research. A system was developed to combine a haptic programming library with a physical dy- namics engine and to expose its functionality through the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol, an increasingly accepted standard for communication within the audio software and hardware domain. Using OSC messaging, simple 3D objects can be instantiated and constraints on their movement can be specified, allowing the description of physically dy- namic mechanisms. Collision events as well as properties of the objects can be transmitted to the audio system continually to be used for modulating audio synthesis parameters. Some examples of simple virtual musical instruments created with the aid of this system are provided.},

@phdthesis{Pedrosa2007,
	Abstract = {When designing haptic feedback into human-computer interfaces the most common approach is to restrict its deployment to only one of the haptic channels (either force or vibrotactile feedback) and this decision is often biased according to the technological boundaries imposed by the interface design or its purpose. The research presented here outlines a methodology developed to include haptic feedback in a gesture interface used to implement a computer based music instrument. The primary goal of this research is to achieve an increased understanding of how different flavors of haptic feedback should be combined to support both controllability and comfort in expressive interfaces such as computer based musical instruments. The work reported here has two parts: 1) a description of an initial user experiment conducted for the purpose of assessing the use of vibrotactile stimuli as rhythmic cues, and 2) a proposed research trajectory which will constitute the theme for a PhD project. The main hypothesis guiding this research is that the best way to include haptic feedback into any design should start by understanding the role each haptic channel plays in the ``real life scenario''. The assumption we will put into test is that the feedback provided for each haptic channel could be developed individually and later on fine tuned when mixed in the final design, and this includes that the addition of any extra cues we might be interested in supplying to the end user to enhance the real life experience should be designed and mixed in each haptic channel before the final blend occurs. This methodology could be defined as a ``perception-based design'': a design approach that starts with a perceptual characterization of the interaction that is being addressed and fine tune the results according to the perceptual load put on the user senses. We expect that the knowledge gathered will be useful not only to a broader spectrum of expressive interfaces but could also be extrapolated to including haptic feedback in other interface designs.},

The tactile display is composed of a6 Ã 5 pin array actuated by 30 piezoelectric bimorphs. The distance between each pin's centers is 1.8 mm. Vertical excursion of each pin is controlled over a 0--0.7 mm range. Perceptual experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the system under three conditions: active touch, passive touch with vibration and passive touch without vibration. The experimental results showed that vibrational stimuli helped subjects discriminate tactile patterns. Measurements of the error rate during discrimination tasks were used to find an optimal vibration frequency for stimuli presented at a constant sensation level (32 SLdB above threshold). The experiment was repeated, this time holding the energy transferred mechanically to the fingertip tissue constant. At low frequencies, we found that the passive stimulation allowed subjects to discriminate just as well as active touch of static stimuli did. The results suggested newpossibilities for displaying texture using passive touch, constant energy and spatially varied vibration frequency. Keywords:},

@article{Goble1993,
	Abstract = {Human psychophysical detection and amplitude discrimination thresholds for 25-Hz sinusoidal vibrations were measured on the thenar eminence using two-interval forced-choice tracking, in the unadapted state and following exposure to 25-Hz adapting stimuli representing a range of amplitudes (5-25 dB SL). As expected, detection threshold was elevated 6 to 7 dB for each 10-dB increase in the adapting stimulus. In contrast, amplitude difference thresholds for 10 and 20 dB SL standard stimuli were generally lowest when the amplitude of the adapting stimulus was equal to the amplitude of the standard. The results indicate that while adaptation impairs detection of a liminal vibrotactile stimulus, it improves intensity discrimination of supraliminal stimuli that are close in amplitude to the adapting stimulus. The compatability between these results and a recently proposed model of cortical dynamics (Whitsel et al., 1989) suggests that cortical events may contribute significantly to the physiological basis of vibrotactile adaptation.},

	Abstract = {This work investigates how haptic percepts are combined across two fingertips. Two single-degree-of-freedom haptic interfaces were used to present virtual bumps to the thumb and index finger of subjects' right hand. As subjects slid the two interfaces from left to right while maintaining a fixed finger separation, they would encounter one bump with the index finger and one with the thumb. The objective bump locations were varied randomly, from spatially coincident to separated by slightly more than the fingertips. Subjects were asked to report the number of bumps in the objective world and the number of times they encountered each bump, and also to point to the locations of the bumps. We found that subjects exhibited a strong bias toward reporting a single objective bump in the virtual world. However, the percept varied from one bump encountered twice, when the two virtual bumps were nearly spatially coincident, to one bump encountered once, which occurred when the two virtual bumps were close to finger separation and therefore encountered nearly simultaneously. The latter result is evidence for a kinesthetic grouping phenomenon: temporally synchronized sensations at multiple fingers can be perceptually collapsed into a single percept in both time and space.},

Sinusoidal vibratory stimuli, delivered by means of a 4-mm-diam probe, were first used to obtain detection threshold values for the two skin sites, the finger tip and the dorsal forearm, at four standard frequencies, 20, 50, 100, and 200 Hz. Values confirmed previous results showing detection thresholds were markedly higher on hairy skin than on glabrous skin. For the discrimination task, each standard frequency, at an amplitude four times detection threshold, was paired with a series of comparison frequencies, and discrimination capacity then was quantified by deriving from psychometric function curves, measures of the discriminable frequency increment (Deltaf) and the Weber Fraction (Deltaf/f), which, when plotted as a function of the four standard frequencies, revealed similar capacities for frequency discrimination at the two skin sites at the standard frequencies of 20, 100, and 200 Hz but an equivocal difference at 50 Hz. Cutaneous local anesthesia produced a marked impairment in vibrotactile detection and discrimination at the low standard frequencies of 20 and 50 Hz but little effect at higher frequencies. In summary, the results reveal, first, a striking similarity in vibrotactile discriminative performance in hairy and glabrous skin despite marked differences in detection thresholds for the two sites, and, second, the results confirm that vibrotactile detection and discrimination in hairy skin depend on superficial receptors at low frequencies but depend on deep, probably Pacinian corpuscle, receptors for high frequencies.},

@article{Egloff2012,
	Abstract = {Building on previous findings, the project reported here expands on the idea of how the modality of touch contributes to the sensory perception of sound in the presence of vibro-tactile events. The SenseAble1.0, a vibrotactile interface, was developed to transform the auditory parameter space into one that is adequate for hapticperception by the means of eight individually controllable actuators and machine learning algorithms. Due to the process of sensory substitution, people with hearing impairments can use the vibrotactile display to ``listen'' to music and perceive exterior acoustic stimuli through the sense of touch. A psychophysical pilot study investigated (i) frequency discrimination and pitch direction as well as (ii) interval size recognition of the haptic modality, and (iii) adaptation effects of the somatosensory system. Live performances using the SenseAble as a vibrotactile music system illustrate to what extent musical communication between ensemble members and a hearing-impaired musician is possible. A new prototype with enhanced spatial resolution properties for perceiving vibrotactile stimuli will be introduced as well. It was designed to improve the usability of sensory substitution systems in real and virtual environments and to maximize the efficiency of co-located and telematic performances in terms of musical communication and interaction.},

@techreport{Myles2007,
	Abstract = {Even though vision is only one modality we use to interact with our environment, most people identify it to be the most important. Hearing is also viewed as necessary for interpreting environmental stimuli. In contrast, touch, smell, and taste are largely ignored as being essential to the interaction we have with our environment. The brain seldom processes environmental information in sequence among the modalities but concurrently from several or all of the sensory modalities. Because humans have a limited capacity to receive, hold in working memory, and cognitively process information taken from the environment, the use of one sensory modality to convey information within a system can overload that modality. Multimodal systems can help to alleviate overload for any one modality, and such systems have been favorable in showing that the touch or tactile modality can be used as an independent input modality to convey information to the user or as a redundant modality to increase information prominence of the visual and auditory modalities. This review, which reflects work that occurred before mid-2006, discusses the following aspects of tactile modality: specific measures of tactile sensitivity for the human body, capabilities and limitations of tactile modality, and applications of human tactile interfaces. The review also highlights a gap in the tactile literature regarding tactile research for the head and other potential body locations.},

Users hear the piano music and feel the vibrations indicating which finger is used to play the note. We investigate the system's potential for passive learning, i.e. learning piano playing automatically while engaged in everyday activities. In a preliminary study, four subjects learned two songs initially and then wore the PianoTouch glove for 30 minutes while listening to the songs repeated. One of the songs included tactile sensations and the other did not. The study found that after 30 minutes, the PianoTouch subjects were able to play the song accompanied by tactile sensations better than the non-tactile song. These results suggest the value of a more detailed study.},

	Abstract = {This study estimated the maximum allowable system latency for haptic displays that produce tactile stimuli in response to the hand movements of users. In Experiment 1, two types of detection thresholds were estimated for the time delay of stimuli through psychophysical experiments involving 13 participants. One was a threshold for the users to notice the existence of a time delay. The other was a threshold for the users to experience changes in the perceived textures in comparison with stimuli with no time delay. The estimated thresholds were approximately 60 and 40 ms, respectively. In interviews, the participants reported that they experienced various types of subjective changes due to the time delay. In Experiment 2, the types of subjective sensations that might be altered by the time delay were investigated. The time delays were controlled based on the acceleration of the hand motions of the participants. The participants evaluated the differences in the perceived textures between the stimuli with a controlled time delay and ones with no delay. The results indicated that the participants associated the time-delayed stimuli with changes in mechanical parameters such as kinetic friction coefficient in addition to changes in the perceived roughness of the textures.},

	Abstract = {One of the most vital feedback systems that has been embedded in musicians for centuries is that of physical response. In the same way that auditory information is available and used throughout a performance, a musician will continuously reassess their playing by making use of not only their specialised sensorimotor skills, but also the tangible feedback that is relayed to them through the body of the instrument. This paper discusses approaches to the development of an augmented instrument, namely the hybrid piano, which focuses on the notion of performance as perceptually guided action. While the acoustic component of the sound energy of the augmented instrument is created within the real- world interactions between hammers, resonating strings, and the soundboard, the digital sonic events cannot be located in a similar palpable source. By exploring notions of multimodality and haptic feedback, the ongoing processes of human action and perception within instrumental performance can be maintained for the player, whilst arguably, also enhancing the experience for the listener.},

To define appropriate roles for haptic interaction, it is necessary to integrate a basic awareness of human capabilities on one hand and current device technology on the other. Here, I explore this integration by first summarizing the most salient constraints imposed by both humans and hardware. I then proceed to relate perceptual, motor, and attentional capabilities to a selection of emerging application contexts chosen to be relevant to contemporary design trends and opportunities. These include abstract communication and notification, augmentation of graphical user interfaces, expressive control, affective communication, and mobile and handheld computing.},

Although our actions can modify our perceptions externally, by modifying the world or our view of it, it has recently become clear that even without this external feedback the preparation and execution of a variety of motor actions can have an effect on three-dimensional perceptual processes. Here, we review the ways in which an observer's motor actions--locomotion, head and eye movements, and object manipulation--affect his or her perception and representation of three-dimensional objects and space. Allowing observers to act can drastically change the way they perceive the third dimension, as well as how scientists view depth perception.},

We measured the effects in a study of target acquisition using the classic Fitts' law paradigm with the addition of four lag conditions. At the highest lag tested (225 ins), movement times and error rates increased by 64\% and 21490 respective y, compared to the zero lag condition. We propose a model according to which lag should have a multiplicative effect on Fitts' index of difficulty. The model accounts for 9470 of the variance and is better than alternative models which propose only an additive effect for lag.

	Abstract = {Haptic stimulation can help humans learn perceptual motor skills, but the precise way in which it influences the learning process has not yet been clarified. This study investigates the role of the kinesthetic and cutaneous components of haptic feedback during the learning of a viscous curl field, taking also into account the influence of visual feedback. We present the results of an experiment in which 17 subjects were asked to make reaching movements while grasping a joystick and wearing a pair of cutaneous devices. Each device was able to provide cutaneous contact forces through a moving platform. The subjects received visual feedback about joystick's position. During the experiment, the system delivered a perturbation through (1) full haptic stimulation, (2) kinesthetic stimulation alone, (3) cutaneous stimulation alone, (4) altered visual feedback, or (5) altered visual feedback plus cutaneous stimulation. Conditions 1, 2, and 3 were also tested with the cancellation of the visual feedback of position error. Results indicate that kinesthetic stimuli played a primary role during motor adaptation to the viscous field, which is a fundamental premise to motor learning and rehabilitation. On the other hand, cutaneous stimulation alone appeared not to bring significant direct or adaptation effects, although it helped in reducing direct effects when used in addition to kinesthetic stimulation. The experimental conditions with visual cancellation of position error showed slower adaptation rates, indicating that visual feedback actively contributes to the formation of internal models. However, modest learning effects were detected when the visual information was used to render the viscous field.},

	Abstract = {In musical performance, bodily gestures play an important role in communicating expressive intentions to audiences. Although previous studies have demonstrated that visual information can have an effect on the perceived expressivity of musical performances, the investigation of audiovisual interactions has been held back by the technical difficulties associated with the generation of controlled, mismatching stimuli.With the present study, we aimed to address this issue by utilizing a novel method in order to generate controlled, balanced stimuli that comprised both matching and mismatching bimodal combinations of different expressive intentions. The aim of Experiment 1 was to investigate the relative contributions of auditory and visual kinematic cues in the perceived expressivity of piano performances, and in Experiment 2 we explored possible crossmodal interactions in the perception of auditory and visual expressivity. The results revealed that although both auditory and visual kinematic cues contribute significantly to the perception of overall expressivity, the effect of visual kinematic cues appears to be somewhat stronger. These results also provide preliminary evidence of crossmodal interactions in the perception of auditory and visual expressivity. In certain performance conditions, visual cues had an effect on the ratings of auditory expressivity, and auditory cues had a small effect on the ratings of visual expressivity.},

@article{Chubb2010,
	Abstract = {We discuss the design and performance of a new haptic surface capable of controlling shear force on a bare finger. At the heart of the ShiverPaD is the TPaD variable friction device. It modulates the friction of a glass surface by using 39 kHz out-of-plane vibrations to reduce friction. To generate shear forces, the TPaD is oscillated in-plane (i.e., ``shivered'') while alternating between low and high friction within each cycle. In previous research, the ShiverPaD produced shear forces using in-plane vibrations below 100 Hz. In this research, we develop a new ShiverPaD that produces force using 854 Hz vibrations, where human sensitivity to vibration is diminished. The new device is used to display a virtual toggle switch and a variety of virtual edges. A human subject study is conducted to demonstrate that users can easily trace virtual edges displayed on the surface of the ShiverPaD.},

	Abstract = {For the perception of the hardness of compliant materials, several cues are available. In this paper, the relative roles of force/displacement and surface deformation cues are investigated. We have measured discrimination thresholds with silicone rubber stimuli of differing thickness and compliance. Also, the influence of the finger span is assessed. When compliance is expressed as the Young's modulus, the thresholds in the different conditions follow Weber's law with a Weber fraction of 15 percent. When the surface deformation cue was removed, thresholds more than trebled. Under the assumption of optimal cue combination, this suggests that a large fraction of the information comes from the surface deformation cue. Using a matching experiment, we found that differences in object thickness are correctly taken into account. When cues appear to contradict each other, the conflict is resolved by means of a compromise.},

@article{Tan1999,
	Abstract = {In this work, the tactual information transmission capabilities of a tactual display designed to provide stimulation along a continuum from kinesthetic movements to cutaneous vibrations are assessed. The display is capable of delivering arbitrary waveforms to three digits (thumb, index, and middle finger) within an amplitude range from absolute detection threshold to about 50 dB sensation level and a frequency range from dc to above 300 Hz. Stimulus sets were designed at each of three signal durations (125, 250, and 500 msec) by combining salient attributes, such as frequency (further divided into low, middle, and high regions), amplitude, direction of motion, and finger location. Estimated static information transfer (IT) was 6.5 bits at 500 msec, 6.4 bits at 250 msec, and 5.6 bits at 125 msec. Estimates of IT rate were derived from identification experiments in which the subject's task was to identify the middle stimulus in a sequence of three stimuli randomly selected from a given stimulus set. On the basis of the extrapolations from these IT measurements to continuous streams, the IT rate was estimated to be about 12 bits/sec, which is roughly the same as that achieved by Tadoma users in tactual speech communication.},

The relative utility of amplitude and pulse train frequency modulated stimulation paradigms for providing vibrotactile feedback for object manipulation was assessed in 10 participants. The two approaches were studied during virtual object manipulation using a robotic interface as a function of presentation order and a simultaneous cognitive load. Despite the potential pragmatic benefits associated with pulse train frequency modulated vibrotactile stimulation, comparison of the approach with amplitude modulation indicates that amplitude modulation vibrotactile stimulation provides superior feedback for object manipulation.},

We hypothesize that sub-threshold forces become perceivable when a vibration waveform is superimposed onto the force signal. We study the human capabilities in perception of harmonic forces, and we observe lower thresholds for sinusoidal waves than for onset force. Starting from these perceptual findings, we involve a frequency signal instead of a signal amplification to allow the tactile human sensors to sharpen the perception of sub-thresholds forces in a teleoperation task. We report on the results obtained from our experiments and on the method used to reach such goal.},

	Abstract = {Vibrotactile feedback offers much potential for facilitating and accelerating how people learn sensory-motor skills that typically take hundreds of hours to learn, such as learning to play a musical instrument, skiing or swimming. However, there is little evidence of this benefit materializing outside of research lab settings. We describe the findings of an in the wild study that explored how to integrate vibrotactile feedback into a real-world teaching setting. The focus of the study was on exploring how children of different ages, learning to play the violin, can use real-time vibrotactile feedback. Many of the findings were unexpected, showing how students and their teachers appropriated the technology in creative ways. We present some `lessons learned' that are also applicable to other training settings, emphasizing the need to understand how vibrotactile feedback can switch between being foregrounded and backgrounded depending on the demands of the task, the teacher's role in making it work and when feedback is most relevant and useful. Finally, we discuss how vibrotactile feedback can provide a new language for talking about the skill being learned that may also play an instrumental role in enhancing learning.},

@article{Guclu2005,
	Abstract = {A computational model based on previous physiological and psychophysical data is presented for the human Pacinian (P) psychophysical channel. The model can predict the probability of detection in simple psychophysical tasks, and hence psychometric functions and thresholds. The model simulates stimulating variable and fixed glabrous skin sites with different-sized contactors and includes spatial variation of monkey P-fiber sensitivities. Therefore, it is especially suitable for studying spatial summation, i.e. the improvement of threshold with increasing contactor area. Selective contributions of neural integration (n.i.) and probability summation (p.s.) are also incorporated into the model. Model predictions are compared to psychophysical results of Gescheider et al. (2005). The performance of the model regarding the effects of contactor size is very good. In addition to predicting approximately 3 dB improvement of thresholds when the contactor area is doubled, the model also reveals nonlinear contributions of p.s. and n.i. Furthermore, the model asserts that thresholds are largely governed by neural integration when small contactors are used. These and other findings discussed in the article show that the presented model is a helpful tool for formulating testable hypotheses. Although the model can also simulate some temporal summation effects, simulation results do not conform well to previous data on temporal response properties. Thus, the model needs to be refined in that respect.},

	Abstract = {In fingertip interaction with a virtual surface, the illusion of a protruding bump can be created even in the absence of out-of-plane forces or motions, by presenting just the lateral forces associated with sliding over a bump [19]. We found that when a virtual bump on one side of a planar haptic display surface is explored with a fingertip, adding contact with the opposing side of that surface as well (pinch grip) decreases the virtual bump's perceived height. Using two motor-driven sliding contact surfaces (one for either side of the display plane), we determined when a bump traversed with the index finger alone subjectively matched a comparison bump explored with simultaneous thumb contact on the opposing side (the point of subjective equality, or PSE). The decrease in perceived bump height due to opposing surface contact was on the order of 10\%.},

This method was used to analyse the key vibrations of eight pianos (four grand and four upright). The broadband component of vibrations was found to be more intense in the upright pianos than in the grand pianos, while no such difference was found in the tonal component. As grands are considered to be superior to uprights, this suggests that it may be possible to improve upright pianos by reducing the strength of the broadband component of vibrations.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents experiments measuring psychophysical thresholds for multi-finger single point interaction with small haptic effects. Subjects used the UW Multi-Finger Haptic Display to interact with small haptic icons in a virtual environment. A forced-choice adaptive thresholding method is used to find a minimum detectable force magnitude. First, studies are performed to evaluate the consistency of our test apparatus across the four fingertips and to compare our application of the adaptive thresholding method to the prior work. Next, force detection thresholds for individual fingers are collected and compared to the force detection threshold using four fingers simultaneously. The results show comparable force detection levels between index, middle, pinkie and multi-finger interaction (33.5, 32.1, 33.5, 28.9 mN respectively) but less sensitivity with the ring finger (mean threshold of 43.6 mN). Repeated measures analysis of variance and t-tests with Bonferroni correction supports these conclusions. Most importantly, we show that the multi-finger threshold is not significantly lower than the threshold of the individual fingers. The implication for device design is that the relevant multi-finger device parameters are no more stringent than for single finger devices.},

	Abstract = {Music is a rich form of nonverbal communication, in which the movements that expert musicians make during performance can influence the perception of expressive and structural features of the music. Whether the actual skill of a musician is perceivable from vision of movement was examined. In Experiment 1, musicians and non-musicians rated performances by novice, intermediate and expert clarinettists from point-light animations of their movements, sound recordings, or both. Performances by clarinettists of more advanced skill level were rated significantly higher from vision of movements, although this effect was stronger when sound was also presented. In Experiment 2, movements and sound from the novice and expert clarinettists' performances were switched for half the presentations, and were matched for the rest. Ratings of novice music were significantly higher when presented with expert movements, although the opposite was not found for expert sound presented with novice movements. No perceptual effect of raters' own level of musicianship was found in either experiment. These results suggest that expertise is perceivable from vision of musicians' body movements, although perception of skill from sound is dominant. The results from Experiment 2 further indicate a cross-modal effect of vision and audition on the perception of musical expertise.},

This paper will consider aesthetic and technical issues relating to: (1) the social/cultural construction of contexts for chamber music and dance; (2) our construction of gestural ``composed instruments'' and integrated sonic display devices; (3) concepts of the integration of the dancing body and the musical body; and (4) new approaches to interactive music and improvisation in a ``composed context.'' Our approach prioritizes music as ``activity'' in both instrument design and sonic display.

	Abstract = {It is really interesting to know how a blood flow has an influence on a touch sensitivity during human fingertip exploration over an environment. In this paper, we examine experimentally how the touch sensitivity is changed under the condition that the blood flow is interrupted compulsorily by pressing the proximal phalange of human finger. Through the weight discrimination test based on Weber's Law, we found that the touch sensitivity improves temporarily with the statistical significance test of below 0.1 \%, when a finger proximal phalange is bound and pressed. Experimental results also show that there exists a meaningful correlationship between the stiffness of fingertip and the touch sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {Maximum isometric finger-grip forces were predicted using a biomechanical model for plane motion of the middle finger. In the course of this study, mathematical representations of tendon displacement, the moment arm of tendon at the finger joints and muscle force-length relationship were investigated. The information gathered was applied to the model to estimate the maximum grip force of the middle finger gripping cylinders of different sizes. Muscle force per unit physiological cross-section area of 30 N/cm2 resulted in good agreement with measured force. However, for finger postures having an acute proximal interphalangeal joint angle, the estimated force was greater than that measured. Various joint angles were applied to the model to simulate the wrist and finger postures not limited to the cylinder grip. In general the finger force was greatest with the wrist in its extended position and at acute flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The maximum finger force occurred at reduced metacarpophalangeal joint angles as the wrist joint changed from an extended position to a flexed one. It is also postulated that muscle force-length relationship is an important factor in muscle force predictions. The data obtained by this research are useful for the design of handles and the current model is applicable to the analysis of hand postures for workers using hand tools.},

@article{Franz2012,
	Abstract = {Repeated measures designs are common in experimental psychology. Because of the correlational structure in these designs, the calculation and interpretation of confidence intervals is nontrivial. One solution was provided by Loftus and Masson (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review 1:476-490, 1994). This solution, although widely adopted, has the limitation of implying same-size confidence intervals for all factor levels, and therefore does not allow for the assessment of variance homogeneity assumptions (i.e., the circularity assumption, which is crucial for the repeated measures ANOVA). This limitation and the method's perceived complexity have sometimes led scientists to use a simplified variant, based on a per-subject normalization of the data (Bakeman \& McArthur, Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, \& Computers 28:584-589, 1996; Cousineau, Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology 1:42-45, 2005; Morey, Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology 4:61-64, 2008; Morrison \& Weaver, Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, \& Computers 27:52-56, 1995). We show that this normalization method leads to biased results and is uninformative with regard to circularity. Instead, we provide a simple, intuitive generalization of the Loftus and Masson method that allows for assessment of the circularity assumption.},

	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the perception of complex vibrotactile stimuli in which a few sinusoidal vibrations with different frequencies are superimposed. We begin with an observation that such vibrotactile signals are analogous to musical chords in which multiple notes are played simultaneously. A set of so-called "vibrotactile chords" are designed on the basis of musical chords, and their degrees of consonance (harmony) that participants perceive are evaluated through a perceptual experiment. Experimental results indicate that participants can reliably rate the degrees of consonance of vibrotactile chords and establish a well-defined function that relates the degree of consonance to the base and chordal frequency of a vibrotactile chord. These findings have direct implications for the design of complex vibrotactile signals that can be produced by current wideband actuators such as voice-coil, piezoelectric, and electroactive polymer actuators.},

	Abstract = {The detectability and discriminability of virtual haptic gratings were analyzed in the frequency domain. Detection (Exp. 1) and discrimination (Exp. 2) thresholds for virtual haptic gratings were estimated using a force-feedback device that simulated sinusoidal and square-wave gratings with spatial periods from 0.2 to 38.4 mm. The detection threshold results indicated that for spatial periods up to 6.4 mm (i.e., spatial frequencies >0.156 cycle/mm), the detectability of square-wave gratings could be predicted quantitatively from the detection thresholds of their corresponding fundamental components. The discrimination experiment confirmed that at higher spatial frequencies, the square-wave gratings were initially indistinguishable from the corresponding fundamental components until the third harmonics were detectable. At lower spatial frequencies, the third harmonic components of square-wave gratings had lower detection thresholds than the corresponding fundamental components. Therefore, the square-wave gratings were detectable as soon as the third harmonic components were detectable. Results from a third experiment where gratings consisting of two superimposed sinusoidal components were compared (Exp. 3) showed that people were insensitive to the relative phase between the two components. Our results have important implications for engineering applications, where complex haptic signals are transmitted at high update rates over networks with limited bandwidths.},

We present a cognitive neuroscience theoretical perspective on multisensory integration and propose that this may be a useful way of conceptualizing and studying sensory integration and the perceptual experience of persons with autism. Our goal is to operationalize the concept of sensory integration, a notion that is frequently alluded to in the field of autism yet rarely defined in empirical terms. We conclude with a discussion of how this re-conceptualization and study of sensory integration may generate testable hypotheses and lead to refinements in current perceptual theories of autism.},

@article{Asano2014a,
	Abstract = {We have developed a texture display system that modifies the perceived roughness of textured surfaces via a voice coil actuator worn on the finger. To increase the roughness sensations, the vibrotactile stimuli from the actuator simulate the skin deformations that are activated when a wavy surface is scanned. Conversely, to decrease the roughness sensations of the textured surface, a high-frequency vibrotactile stimulus offsets the activity levels of tactile mechanoreceptors. This offset suppresses the perceived roughness of the surfaces being touched, with increase in the offset correlating with increase in the feeling of smoothness of the surfaces. We conducted an experiment in which we tested the effects of these two types of vibrotactile stimulation on grating roughness specimens, with subjective responses acquired from eight participants via the magnitude estimation method. The results obtained indicate that our method selectively increases and decreases the roughness felt. The intention is for the technique to be used to develop an augmented reality device for textures.},

GDDTs were measured in three groups of observers (normal-hearing, hearing-impaired, and normal-hearing with simulated hearing loss) covering an age range of 21--69 yr. GDDTs for a baseline gap of 6 ms were measured for four different combinations of 100-ms leading and trailing markers (250--250, 250--400, 400--250, and 400--400 Hz). Auditory measurements were obtained for monaural presentation over headphones and tactile measurements were obtained using sinusoidal vibrations presented to the left middle finger. The auditory GDDTs of the hearing-impaired listeners, which were larger than those of the normal-hearing observers, were well-reproduced in the listeners with simulated loss. The magnitude of the GDDT was generally independent of modality and showed effects of age in both modalities. The use of different-frequency compared to same-frequency markers led to a greater deterioration in auditory GDDTs compared to tactile GDDTs and may reflect differences in bandwidth properties between the two sensory systems.},

@article{Frissen2012a,
	Abstract = {In two experiments we investigated the effects of voluntary movements on temporal haptic perception. Measures of sensitivity (JND) and temporal alignment (PSS) were obtained from temporal order judgments made on intermodal auditory-haptic (Experiment 1) or intramodal haptic (Experiment 2) stimulus pairs under three movement conditions. In the baseline, static condition, the arm of the participants remained stationary. In the passive condition, the arm was displaced by a servo-controlled motorized device. In the active condition, the participants moved voluntarily. The auditory stimulus was a short, 500Hz tone presented over headphones and the haptic stimulus was a brief suprathreshold force pulse applied to the tip of the index finger orthogonally to the finger movement. Active movement did not significantly affect discrimination sensitivity on the auditory-haptic stimulus pairs, whereas it significantly improved sensitivity in the case of the haptic stimulus pair, demonstrating a key role for motor command information in temporal sensitivity in the haptic system. Points of subjective simultaneity were by-and-large coincident with physical simultaneity, with one striking exception in the passive condition with the auditory-haptic stimulus pair. In the latter case, the haptic stimulus had to be presented 45ms before the auditory stimulus in order to obtain subjective simultaneity. A model is proposed to explain the discrimination performance.},

@article{Finney1997,
	Abstract = {In an investigation into the role of auditory feedback guidance in musical electrical performance, musically experience subjects performed on an electronic keyboard under altered feedback conditions that included pitch and timing manipulations, as well as absence of auditory feedback. The results largely replicated the data reported by Gates and Bradshaw (1974): performance in the ansence of auditory feedback showed no impairment, whereas performance under delayed auditory feedback showed significant impairment. In an extension of the Gates and Bradshaw study, however, it was found that altered pitch feedback caused little or no impairment and that altering th pitches in the delayed auditory feedback condition significantly reduced the amount of delayed auditory feedback impairment. These results show that different components of auditory feedback (pitch and timing) have separable effects on musical performance and pose a problem for theories of auditory feedback effects that do not explicity distinguish these components.},

Increase in timing errors indicate a possible break- point around 55 ms. As the feedback was delayed even more subjects showed increased difficulties in maintaining a steady rhythm.},

@article{Huang2012,
	Abstract = {Musicians often say that they not only hear, but also "feel" music. To explore the contribution of tactile information in "feeling" musical rhythm, we investigated the degree that auditory and tactile inputs are integrated in humans performing a musical meter recognition task. Subjects discriminated between two types of sequences, 'duple' (march-like rhythms) and 'triple' (waltz-like rhythms) presented in three conditions: 1) Unimodal inputs (auditory or tactile alone), 2) Various combinations of bimodal inputs, where sequences were distributed between the auditory and tactile channels such that a single channel did not produce coherent meter percepts, and 3) Simultaneously presented bimodal inputs where the two channels contained congruent or incongruent meter cues. We first show that meter is perceived similarly well (70\%-85\%) when tactile or auditory cues are presented alone. We next show in the bimodal experiments that auditory and tactile cues are integrated to produce coherent meter percepts. Performance is high (70\%-90\%) when all of the metrically important notes are assigned to one channel and is reduced to 60\% when half of these notes are assigned to one channel. When the important notes are presented simultaneously to both channels, congruent cues enhance meter recognition (90\%). Performance drops dramatically when subjects were presented with incongruent auditory cues (10\%), as opposed to incongruent tactile cues (60\%), demonstrating that auditory input dominates meter perception. We believe that these results are the first demonstration of cross-modal sensory grouping between any two senses.},

@article{Altinsoy2012a,
	Abstract = {In our daily lives, we usually perceive an event via more than one sensory modality (e.g., vision, hearing, touch). Therefore, multimodal integration and interactions play an important role when we use objects and for event recognition in our environment. A virtual environment (VE) is a computer simulation of a realistic-looking and interactive world. VEs should take into account the multisensory nature of humans and communicate with the user not only through vision but also through other modalities. In addition to vision, hearing and touch are the most commonly used communication channels. Recently, a variety of products with additional tactile input and output capabilities have been developed (e.g., Apple iPhone and other touch-screen devices, NintendoWii, etc.). Some of these devices provide new possibilities for interacting with a computer, including the auditory modality. Binaural synthesis and rendering are becoming key technologies for multimedia products. Virtual environments are no longer limited to academic research; they have commercial applications, particularly in medicine, game, and entertainment industries. Thus, the quality of VEs is becoming increasingly important. User interaction with a VE is a key issue in the perception of its quality. Several studies have discussed the quality of displays, input and output devices (for different modalities) as well as software and hardware issues; however, multimodal user interaction should also be examined. This paper focuses on the parameters that influence the quality of audio-tactile VEs.},

@article{Wollman2014a,
	Abstract = {The role of auditory and tactile modalities involved in violin playing and evaluation was investigated in an experiment employing a blind violin evaluation task under different conditions: i) normal playing conditions, ii) playing with auditory masking, and iii) playing with vibrotactile masking. Under each condition, 20 violinists evaluated five violins according to criteria related to violin playing and sound characteristics and rated their overall quality and relative preference. Results show that both auditory and vibrotactile feedback are important in the violinists' evaluations but that their relative importance depends on the violinist, the violin and the type of evaluation (different criteria ratings or preference). In this way, the overall quality ratings were found to be accurately predicted by the rating criteria, which also proved to be perceptually relevant to violinists, but were poorly correlated with the preference ratings; this suggests that the two types of ratings (overall quality vs preference) may stem from different decision-making strategies. Furthermore, the experimental design confirmed that violinists agree more on the importance of criteria in their overall evaluation than on their actual ratings for different violins. In particular, greater agreement was found on the importance of criteria related to the sound of the violin. Nevertheless, this study reveals that there are fundamental differences in the way players interpret and evaluate each criterion, which may explain why correlating physical properties with perceptual properties has been challenging so far in the field of musical acoustics.},

However, both hit and false alarm rates for detecting tactile stimuli were significantly higher on tone than on no-tone trials. This finding, coupled with the finding that magnitude estimations of tactile stimuli were higher on tone than on no-tone trials, is interpreted as support for the hypothesis that auditory stimulation can facilitate neural activity in the tactile sensory system.},

Alterations of auditory feedback can profoundly disrupt performance, though not all alterations cause dis- ruption and different alterations generate different types of disruption. Recent results have revealed a basic distinction between the role of feedback contents (musical pitch) and the degree to which feedback onsets are synchronized with actions. These results further suggest a theoretical framework for the coordination of actions with feedback in which perception and action share a common representation of sequence structure.},

	Abstract = {Current development in multimodal interfaces allows us to interact with digitally represented objects. Sadly, these representations are often poor due to technical limitations in representing some of the sensorial properties. Here we explore the possibility of overcoming these limitations by exploiting multisensory integration processes and propose a sound-based interaction technique to alter the perceived materiality of a surface being touched and to shape users' touch behavior. The latter can be seen both as a cue of, and as a means to reinforce, the altered perception. We designed a prototype that dynamically alters the texture-related sound feedback based on touch behavior, as in natural surface touch interactions. A user study showed that the frequency of the sound feedback alters texture perception (coldness and material type) and touch behavior (velocity and pressure). We conclude by discussing lessons learnt from this work in terms of HCI applications and questions opened},

	Abstract = {In performing most everyday tasks, we use information from several different sensory modalities, yet our understanding of how these inputs are integrated is limited. The present study investigated the role of multisensory feedback in the perception of surface roughness, specifically focusing on whether the threshold for distinguishing the roughness of two virtual surfaces was different under visual + haptic conditions, as compared to visual-only or haptic-only conditions. Haptic stimuli were presented via the PHANToM; visual stimuli were presented via computer monitor. The virtual surfaces were sinusoidal gratings that varied in spatial period across trials. Overall, results suggested that threshold was determined by haptic input at low surface amplitudes, and by visual input at high surface amplitudes. At intermediate amplitude values, it appeared that observers were combining information across modalities to produce a percept in the combined condition that was better than that obtained under either single modality condition.},

@article{LagardeKelso:movementSoundTouch,
	Abstract = {Very little is known about the coordination of movement in combination with stimuli such as sound and touch. The present research investigates the hypothesis that both the type of action (e.g., a flexion or extension movement) and the sensory modality (e.g., auditory or tactile) determine the stability of multimodal coordination. We performed a parametric study in which the ability to synchronize movement, touch and sound was explored over a broad range of stimulus frequencies or rates. As expected, synchronization of finger movement with external auditory and tactile stimuli was successfully established and maintained across all frequencies. In the key experimental conditions, participants were instructed to synchronize peak flexion of the index finger with touch and peak extension with sound (and vice-versa). In this situation, tactile and auditory stimuli were delivered counter-phase to each other. Two key effects were observed. First, switching between multimodal coordination patterns occurred, with transitions selecting one multimodal pattern (flexion with sound and extension with touch) more often than its partner. This finding indicates that the stability of multimodal coordination is influenced by both the type of action and the stimulus modality. Second, at higher rates, transitions from coherent to incoherent phase relations between touch, movement and sound occurred, attesting to the breakdown of multimodal coordination. Because timing errors in multimodal coordination were systematically altered when compared to unimodal control conditions we are led to consider the role played by time delays in multimodal coordination dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The ability to predict the effects of actions is necessary to behave properly in our physical and social world. Here, we describe how the ability to predict the consequence of complex gestures can change the way we integrate sight and sound when relevant visual information is missing. Six drummers and six novices were asked to judge audiovisual synchrony for drumming point-light displays where the visual information was manipulated to eliminate or include the drumstick-drumhead impact point. In the condition with only the arm information novices were unable to detect asynchrony whereas drummers were able to. Additionally, in the conditions that included the impact point drummers perceived the best alignment when the sight preceded the sound, while in the arm only condition they perceived the best alignment when the sound occurred together with or preceded the sight, as it would be expected if they were predicting the beat occurrence. Taken together these findings suggest that humans can acquire, through practice, internal models of action which can be used to replace missing information when integrating multisensory signals from the environment.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the performance of force-reflecting
interfaces ("haptic displays"). We suggest that an important measure
of performance is the dynamic range of achievable impedances --
"Z-Width" -- and that an impedance is achievable if it satisfies a
robustness property such as passivity. Several factors affecting
Z-Width -- sample-and-hold, inherent interface dynamics,
displacement sensor quantization, and velocity filtering -- are
discussed. A set of experiments designed to evaluate these factors
is described, and experimental results are presented. A striking
result is that inherent interface damping exerts an overwhelming
influence on Z-Width.},

@article{Klatzky1989a,
	Abstract = {Planar objects varying in shape, texture, and hardness were classified under haptic exploration. Classes were defined by values on one dimension, or redundantly, by two or three dimensions. Response times and exploratory procedures (Lederman \& Klatzky, 1987) were recorded. Experiment 1 showed that a second dimension speeded responses for all combinations (redundancy gain), but a third dimension produced no further effect. In Experiments 2 and 3, classification trials began with two redundant dimensions, and subsequently one was withdrawn (held constant). When texture and hardness varied redundantly, withdrawal of either increased response time--even when subjects were initially instructed to focus on one dimension. Joint exploration for texture and hardness dominated whenever the two varied redundantly and persisted despite withdrawal. Redundancy gains (Experiment 1), but not substantial withdrawal effects (Experiments 2 and 3), were observed for combinations of texture or hardness with planar contour, indicating less integration than between substance dimensions. Compatibility of exploratory procedures appears to constrain dimensional integration.},

We begin by considering the nature of manual exploration in terms of the characteristics of various exploratory procedures (EPs) or stereotypical patterns of hand movements. Next, we explore their consequences for the sequence of EPs selected, for the relative cognitive salience of material versus geometric properties, and for dimensional integration. Finally, we discuss several applications of our research programme to the development of tangible graphics displays for the blind, autonomous and teleoperated haptic robotic systems, and food evaluation in the food industry.},

@article{Occelli2011,
	Abstract = {In the present review, we focus on how commonalities in the ontogenetic development of the auditory and tactile sensory systems may inform the interplay between these signals in the temporal domain. In particular, we describe the results of behavioral studies that have investigated temporal resolution (in temporal order, synchrony/asynchrony, and simultaneity judgment tasks), as well as temporal numerosity perception, and similarities in the perception of frequency across touch and hearing. The evidence reviewed here highlights features of audiotactile temporal perception that are distinctive from those seen for other pairings of sensory modalities. For instance, audiotactile interactions are characterized in certain tasks (e.g., temporal numerosity judgments) by a more balanced reciprocal influence than are other modality pairings. Moreover, relative spatial position plays a different role in the temporal order and temporal recalibration processes for audiotactile stimulus pairings than for other modality pairings. The effect exerted by both the spatial arrangement of stimuli and attention on temporal order judgments is described. Moreover, a number of audiotactile interactions occurring during sensory-motor synchronization are highlighted. We also look at the audiotactile perception of rhythm and how it may be affected by musical training. The differences emerging from this body of research highlight the need for more extensive investigation into audiotactile temporal interactions. We conclude with a brief overview of some of the key issues deserving of further research in this area.},

	Abstract = {Various psychophysical methods have been used to study human haptic perception, although the selection of a particular method is often based on convention, rather than an analysis of which technique is optimal for the question being addressed. In this review, classical psychophysical techniques used to measure sensory thresholds are described as well as more modern methods such as adaptive procedures and those associated with signal detection theory. Details are provided as to how these techniques should be implemented to measure absolute and difference thresholds and factors that influence subjects' responses are noted. In addition to the methods used to measure sensory thresholds, the techniques available for measuring the perception of suprathreshold stimuli are presented. These scaling methods are reviewed in the context of the various stimulus and response biases that influence how subjects respond to stimuli. The importance of understanding the factors that influence perceptual processing is highlighted throughout the review with reference to experimental studies of haptic perception.},

@article{Kaim2011,
	Abstract = {Haptic perception essentially depends on the executed exploratory movements. It has been speculated that spontaneously executed movements are optimized for the computation of associated haptic properties. We investigated to what extent people strategically execute movements that are tuned for softness discrimination of objects with deformable surfaces. In Experiment 1, we investigated how movement parameters depend on expected stimulus compliance. In a discrimination task, we measured exploratory forces for less compliant (hard) stimuli and for more compliant (soft) stimuli. In Experiment 2, we investigated whether exploratory force also depends on the expected compliance difference between the two stimuli. The results indicate that participants apply higher forces when expecting harder objects as compared to softer objects, and they apply higher forces for smaller compliance differences than for larger ones. Experiment 3 examined how applied force influences differential sensitivity for softness as assessed by just noticeable differences (JNDs). For soft stimuli, JNDs did not depend on force. For hard stimuli, JNDs were ``worse'' (higher) if participants applied less force than they use naturally. We conclude that applying high force is a robust strategy to obtain high differential sensitivity, and that participants used this strategy if it was required for successful discrimination performance.},

Perceptual threshold values for auditory-tactile asynchrony were measured using a broadband noise for the auditory stimulus (presented to the subjects via headphones) and a sinusoidal wave for the tactile stimulus (presented at the tip of the index finger via a shaker). In the first experiment, subjects were asked to make a three-alternative forced-choice judgment whether the audio stimulus and the tactile stimulus were synchronous, the audio stimulus preceded the tactile stimulus, or the tactile stimulus preceded the audio stimulus. Stimuli with audio delays in the range of --26 to 51 ms were judged synchronous. In the second experiment, the judgement was whether the auditory stimulus and the tactile stimulus were synchronous or asynchronous. The results showed that stimuli with audio delays in the range of --24 to 50 ms were judged synchronous. In the third experiment the subjects had to judge whether the audio stimulus preceded the tactile stimulus, or the tactile stimulus preceded the audio stimulus. Stimuli with audio delays in the range of --13 to 28 ms were judged synchronous.},

The MEMS array is covered by a polymeric packaging with biomimetic fingerprints enhancing the sensitivity in roughness encoding.

Hence, surfaces differing down to 40\&\#x00A0;\&\#x03BC;m are identified in active-touch by both hardware and processing methods based on exteroceptive tactile information. Finally, active-touch results with five textiles (which differ in texture or orientation) are shown as a preliminary qualitative assessment of discrimination in a more realistic tactile-stimulation scenario.},

	Abstract = {Tactile displays are often used to present spatial cues about the environment, although the optimal configuration of a display used for spatial cuing is not known. The objective of the present set of experiments was to characterize the properties of surface waves induced by vibrotactile stimulation and to determine if the propagation of surface waves was a factor influencing the ability to localize a point of stimulation in a tactile display. Three sites on the body were tested: the palm of the hand, the forearm, and the thigh. An accelerometer array was fabricated and used to measure the surface waves. The results indicated that there were significant differences between glabrous and hairy skin in terms of the frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the motor. Analyses of the motion of the surface waves across the skin indicated that they were markedly attenuated at 8 mm from the motor, but even at 24 mm the amplitude was still above perceptual threshold. The localization experiment indicated that subjects were much better at identifying the site of stimulation on the palm as compared to the forearm and thigh, and that the latter two sites were not significantly different.},

@article{Garcia-Hernandez2011,
	Abstract = {Tactile arrays are devices that can provide spatially distributed cutaneous signals delivering crucial information during virtual haptic exploration or remote manipulation procedures. Two of the key specifications of a tactile array are the tactor spacing and array size that are believed to directly affect the device performance. In most of the systems developed so far, these two parameters have been chosen by trial and error or by trying to match the tactor density to the spatial resolution in the human fingertip. The objective of this work is to study the effect of tactor spacing and array size on the tactile arrays performance by measuring human tactile discrimination ability. Psychophysical experiments were performed to obtain the differential threshold for discrimination of a ridge angle and the shape recognition performance while exploring edge-based patterns. The patterns were explored through different passive (nonactuated) tactile arrays of vertically moving pins and also directly with the finger. Results indicate that a tactile array of 1.8 mm tactor spacing and 1 cm2 array size transmits the pattern information with a good level of accuracy. This work shows that tactile devices with low complexity (small number of tactors) are still effective in conveying tactile cues. Moreover, this work provides performance measures that determinate the capabilities of tactile pin arrays to convey accurately tactile information.},

	Abstract = {Apraxic stroke patients need to perform repetitive arm movements to regain motor functionality, but they struggle to process the vi- sual feedback provided by typical virtual rehabilitation systems. In- stead, we imagine a low cost sleeve that can measure the movement of the upper limb and provide tactile feedback at key locations. The feedback provided by the tactors should guide the patient through a series of desired movements by allowing him or her to feel limb configuration errors at each instant in time. After discussing the relevant motion capture and actuator options, this paper describes the design and programming of our current prototype, a wearable tactile interface that uses magnetic motion tracking and shaftless eccentric mass motors. The sensors and actuators are attached to the sleeve of an athletic shirt with novel plastic caps, which also help focus the vibration on the user's skin. We connect the motors in current drive for improved performance, and we present a full parametric model for their in situ dynamic response (acceleration output given current input). 1},

	Abstract = {Vibrotactile thresholds were determined as a function of frequency, contactor configuration, and contactor area. It was found that contactor area is a more important stimulus parameter than the gradient or curvature of displacement. The absolute threshold for vibration seems to be independent of frequency when very small contactors are used and independent of area at low frequencies. For higher values of these parameters, it strongly depends on both. It seems reasonable to conclude that responses to mechanical displacement of the skin are mediated by more than one receptor system, although direct evidence is still lacking.},

The findings were: (a) If contactor penetration into the skin is constant, vibratory threshold amplitude falls off at the rate of 3 dB per doubling at 250 Hz, in agreement with previous studies, (b) There is no increase in vibrotactile magnitude with increase in area at constant amplitude, (c) Increasing static force on the contactor produces an increase in the vibrotactile magnitude. Also, changing contactor force can shift the exponent of the vibrotactile magnitude function. Some discussion is given of the questions raised by the present research, in particular the question of whether static conditions modify not only the mechanics of wave propagation, but also the excitability of neural systems in the tissues.},

Tactile feedback means conveying parameters such as roughness, rigidity, and temperature. These information and many others are obtained thanks to the sense of touch. Tactile feedback is of prime importance in many applications. In this paper we examine the state-of-the-art in tactile interfaces design. Thorough reviews of the literature reveal a significant amount of publications concerning tactile human- machine interfaces, especially onwards the \~{}1990. This paper reports the progress in tactile interfaces technology in the following areas: teleoperation, telepresence, sensory substitution, 3D surface generation, Braille systems, laboratory prototypes, and games. Different parameters and specifications required to generate and feed back tactile sensation are summarized.},

The three commercial haptic devices we used span the cost spectrum, supposing that cost of a device is correlated with the fidelity of its virtual textures. This turned out not to be the case. The results indicated that none of the three haptic devices we tested were able to render perceptually distortion-free, periodically regular vibrations at detection threshold levels. Further investigation into the electrical and mechanical device properties that limited the performance of these devices revealed that D/A resolution, amplifier non-linearity and stiction were the primary sources of signal corruption.},

@article{Spence2013,
	Abstract = {This review addresses the question of when spatial coincidence facilitates multisensory integration in humans. According to the spatial rule (which was first formulated on the basis of neurophysiological data in anesthetized animals), multisensory integration is enhanced when stimuli in different sensory modalities are presented from the same spatial location. While the spatial rule fits with the available data from studies of overt and covert spatial attentional orienting, and from the majority of those studies in which space has been somehow relevant to the participant's task, it is inconsistent with the evidence that has emerged from the majority of multisensory studies of stimulus identification and temporal perception. Such a mixed pattern of behavioral results suggests that the spatial rule does not represent a general constraint on multisensory integration in humans. Instead, it would appear to be a much more task-dependent phenomenon than is often realized. These results, however, are broadly consistent with a distinction between the processing of "where" and "what" (or "how") information processing in the human brain.},

@article{Lalanne2004,
	Abstract = {The integration of information from different sensory modalities has many advantages for human observers, including increase of salience, resolution of perceptual ambiguities, and unified perception of objects and surroundings. Several behavioral, electrophysiological and neuroimaging data collected in various tasks, including localization and detection of spatial events, crossmodal perception of object properties and scene analysis are reviewed here. All the results highlight the multiple faces of crossmodal interactions and provide converging evidence that the brain takes advantages of spatial and temporal coincidence between spatial events in the crossmodal binding of spatial features gathered through different modalities. Furthermore, the elaboration of a multimodal percept appears to be based on an adaptive combination of the contribution of each modality, according to the intrinsic reliability of sensory cue, which itself depends on the task at hand and the kind of perceptual cues involved in sensory processing. Computational models based on bayesian sensory estimation provide valuable explanations of the way perceptual system could perform such crossmodal integration. Recent anatomical evidence suggest that crossmodal interactions affect early stages of sensory processing, and could be mediated through a dynamic recurrent network involving backprojections from multimodal areas as well as lateral connections that can modulate the activity of primary sensory cortices, though future behavioral and neurophysiological studies should allow a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

@article{Kayser2005,
	Abstract = {To form a coherent percept of the environment, our brain combines information from different senses. Such multisensory integration occurs in higher association cortices; but supposedly, it also occurs in early sensory areas. Confirming the latter hypothesis, we unequivocally demonstrate supra-additive integration of touch and sound stimulation at the second stage of the auditory cortex. Using high-resolution fMRI of the macaque monkey, we quantified the integration of auditory broad-band noise and tactile stimulation of hand and foot in anaesthetized animals. Integration was found posterior to and along the lateral side of the primary auditory cortex in the caudal auditory belt. Integration was stronger for temporally coincident stimuli and obeyed the principle of inverse effectiveness: greater enhancement for less effective stimuli. These findings demonstrates that multisensory integration occurs early and close to primary sensory areas and--because it occurs in anaesthetized animals--suggests that this integration is mediated by preattentive bottom-up mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {The objective of the study was to characterize the Pacinian representation of stimulus waveform. Subjects were presented with pairs of high-frequency vibrotactile stimuli that varied in intensity and/or frequency content and made same-different judgments under conditions of low-frequency adaptation designed to minimize the contribution of the RA system. We wished to infer the nature of the information conveyed by the Pacinian system about the stimuli from measured sensitivity (d') to stimulus differences. We first tested the hypothesis that the Pacinian system conveys only intensive information about vibratory stimuli and found that intensive cues could not account for much of the variance in the discrimination data. We then proposed a model characterizing the Pacinian-mediated representation of an arbitrary stimulus as a pattern of activation in a set of frequency-tuned minichannels. The model was shown to predict the discriminability of the stimulus pairs presented in the psychophysical experiments. Furthermore, the model parameters, optimized to fit the discrimination data, were compatible with analogous values obtained in other experimental contexts. One of the assumptions underlying the model is that information about individual spectral components is conveyed in parallel and quasi-independently. By simulating the response of a population of Pacinian afferents to a polyharmonic stimulus, we demonstrated that such a population can simultaneously convey information about multiple frequency components, despite having a homogeneous spectral profile.},

	Abstract = {Previous work (Verrillo, 1963, 1968) has shown that when measured as a change in absolute threshold, spatial summation occurs only at vibration frequencies above 40 Hz. The present study measured vibrotactile spatial summation at suprathreshold amplitudes. A matching- task was used to investig-ate the effect of varying contactor size on sensory magnitude at three different vibration frequencies. Unlike the threshold data, increasing contactor size resulted in increases in sensory magnitude at 25 and 40 Hz as well as at 160 Hz. The amount of summation varied directly with amplitude for the two lower frequencies. In a second experiment, the effect of increasing static force, independent of contactor size, was investigated. The results indicated that the spatial summation effects noted in the first experiment may be due to increases in static force and not contactor area. The implications of these results for the concept of spatial summation and for the duplex mechanoreceptor hypothesis are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The four information-processing channels of glabrous skin have distinct tuning characteristics which appear to be determined in the periphery at the level of sensory receptors and their afferent nerve fibers. The four-channel model [J Acoust Soc Am 84 (1988) 1680] has been updated to include measurement over a wider frequency range of tuning of the P and NP I channels, psychophysically determined by forward-masking and adaptation tuning curve methods. In addition to differences in their tuning, the P and NP channels differ in the following ways: (1) the P channel, but not NP channels, has been found to be capable of temporal summation, which operates by neural integration; (2) the capacity for spatial summation is also an exclusive property of the P channel; (3) sensitivity declines with age at a greater rate in the P channel than in the NP channels; (4) the masking or adaptation of a channel has no effect on the sensitivity of the other channels, although the channels interact in the summation of the perceived magnitudes of stimuli presented to separate channels.},

This audio-haptic relationship has potential for enrich- ing interaction in human-computer interfaces. How can interface designers manipulate attention using audio-haptic media? We propose a theoretical per- ceptual framework for design of audio-haptic media, influenced by aesthetic frameworks in visual theory and audio design. The aesthetic issues of the mul- timodal interplay between audio and haptic modalities are presented, with dis- cussion based on anecdotes from multimedia artists. We use the aesthetic theory to develop four design mechanisms for transition between audio and haptic channels: synchronization, temporal linearization, masking and synchresis. An example composition using these mechanisms, and the multisensory design intent, is discussed by the designers.},

The group contained 42 persons with symptoms of vibration-induced white finger (VWF). Measures of finger thresholds and temperatures were obtained from both hands. It was found that vibrotactile thresholds were higher in subjects reporting VWF. A laboratory investigation indicated that finger temperature had a great effect on the thresholds but that this effect only occurred outside the range of temperatures found in the study of occupationally exposed persons. Laboratory research showed that vibrotactile thresholds should be expected to depend upon vibration exposure immediately prior to the test. The vibration frequency and general configuration of the vibrotactile apparatus also influenced threshold. An awareness of these factors allows guidelines for their control to be suggested.},

@article{Ziat2010,
	Abstract = {In vision, the discovery of the phenomenon of saccadic suppression of displacement has made important contributions to the understanding of the stable world problem. Here, we report a similar phenomenon in the tactile modality. When scanning a single Braille dot with two fingers of the same hand, participants were asked to decide whether the dot was stationary or whether it was displaced from one location to another. The stimulus was produced by refreshable Braille devices that have dots that can be swiftly raised and recessed. In some conditions, the dot was stationary. In others, a displacement was created by monitoring the participant's finger position and by switching the dot activation when it was not touched by either finger. The dot displacement was of either 2.5 mm or 5 mm. We found that in certain cases, displaced dots were felt to be stationary. If the displacement was orthogonal to the finger movements, tactile suppression occurred effectively when it was of 2.5 mm, but when the displacement was of 5 mm, the participants easily detected it. If the displacement was medial-lateral, the suppression effect occurred as well, but less often when the apparent movement of the dot opposed the movement of the finger. In such cases, the stimulus appeared sooner than when the brain could predict it from finger movement, supporting a predictive rather than a postdictive differential processing hypothesis.},

@article{Bolanowski1988,
	Abstract = {Although previous physiological and anatomical experiments have identified four afferent fiber types (PC, RA, SA II, and SA I) in glabrous (nonhairy) skin of the human somatosensory periphery, only three have been shown to mediate tactile (mechanoreceptive) sensation. Psychophysical evidence that four channels (P, NP I, NP II, and NP III) do, indeed, participate in the perceptual process is presented. In a series of experiments involving selective masking of the various channels, modification of the skin-surface temperature, and testing cutaneous sensitivity down to very low-vibratory frequencies, the fourth psychophysical channel (NP III) is defined. Based on these experiments and previous work from our laboratory, it is concluded that the four channels work in conjunction at threshold to create an operating range for the perception of vibration that extends from at least 0.4 to greater than 500 Hz. Each of the four channels appears to mediate specific portions of the overall threshold-frequency characteristic. Selection of appropriate neural-response criteria from previously published physiological data and correlation of their derived frequency characteristics with the four psychophysical channels indicates that each channel has its own physiological substrate: P channel and PC fibers, NP I channel and RA fibers, NP II channel and SA II fibers, and NP III channel and SA I fibers. These channels partially overlap in their absolute sensitivities, making it likely that suprathreshold stimuli may activate two or more of the channels at the same time. Thus the perceptual qualities of touch may be determined by the combined inputs from four channels.},

An acute but temporary rise in threshold occurred as a consequence of the vibration exposure in three different unit types (FA I, FA II and SA I). A close correlation was found between the neural and psychophysical thresholds with regard to the magnitudes of the shifts and the time courses of the recovery, provided that the thresholds were measured at the appropriate frequencies (i.e. at 200, 20 and 2 Hz while recording from FA II, FA I and SA I units, respectively).

Vibrotactile stimuli were matched for subjective intensity across both frequency and duration. Difference limens for vibrotactile frequency were found to decline slightly from 200 ms to 50 ms (attributable to practice) and to increase noticeably at 30 ms.

@article{Craig1976,
	Abstract = {Masked and quiet thresholds at several frequencies of vibratory stimuli were measured as a function of contactor area. The test site was the left index finger; the masking site was the left little finger. The quiet threshold data were consistent with previous investigations: Low-frequency stimuli showed no spatial summation, whereas high-frequency stimuli did. In the presence of a masker, spatial summation was reduced or eliminated for high-frequency stimuli, i.e., the masked threshold was, under some conditions, independent of contactor area. Low-frequency stimuli continued to show no spatial summation in the presence of a masker. The attenuation of spatial summation appears to be a direct function of the intensity of the masking stimulus. Additional measurements with the left thenar eminence as the test site showed that spatial summation could be attenuated by a masker placed on a contralateral body site. The implications of the results for quantifying the effectiveness of a masking stimulus, for the duplex mechanoreceptor hypothesis, and for the nature of spatial summation on the skin are discussed.},

@article{MoriokaAl:VibrotactThresh,
	Abstract = {Thresholds for the perception of vibration vary with location on the body due to the organization of tactile channels in hairy and non-hairy skin, and variations in receptor density. This study determined vibration thresholds at four locations on the body with two different contactors so as to assist the identification of the tactile channel determining the threshold at each location. Vibrotactile thresholds at six frequencies from 8 to 250 Hz were measured on the distal phalanx of the index finger, the volar forearm, the large toe, and the heel with two contactors: (i) a 1-mm diameter circular probe with a 1-mm gap to a fixed circular surround (i.e., 7.1-mm(2) excitation area), and (ii) a 6-mm diameter circular probe with a 2-mm gap to a fixed circular surround (i.e., 79-mm(2) excitation area). At all frequencies and with both contactors, thresholds on the fingertip were lower than thresholds on the volar forearm, the large toe, and the heel, consistent with a greater density of mechanoreceptors at the fingertip. Thresholds with the larger contactor were lower than thresholds with the smaller contactor on the fingertip at high frequencies (63, 125, and 250 Hz), on the large toe (except at 250 Hz), on the heel (at all frequencies), and on the volar forearm at 250 Hz. It is concluded that at least two tactile channels (Pacinian from 63 to 250 Hz, and non-Pacinian from 8 to 31.5 Hz) determined vibrotactile thresholds at the fingertip, whereas non-Pacinian channels had a dominant influence on vibrotactile thresholds at the volar forearm. The role of Pacinian and non-Pacinian channels could not be confirmed at the large toe or the heel despite some evidence of spatial summation.},

@article{Lundstrom1995a,
	Abstract = {Vibrotactile perception thresholds (VPT) at seven test frequencies (8-500 Hz) have been measured and evaluated among 170 male employees at a heavy engineering production workshop, 125 of them were at present, or in the past, exposed to hand-arm vibration. All participants were examined by a physician and none had symptoms of diseases or were exposed to other factors known to cause sensory neuropathies. VPTs [for the three lowest (8-32 Hz; non-Pacinian), for the four highest (63-500 Hz; Pacinian) and for all test frequencies together] and a sensitivity index (SI) has been individually graded in four (normal, slightly deteriorated, deteriorated and seriously deteriorated) and two (normal, abnormal) stages, respectively, and put in relation to individual exposure of vibration. The results do not show any clear relationship on an individual basis between vibration exposure and degraded vibrotactile perception. On a group basis, however, there is a clear tendency towards detoriorated VPTs when the study group is divided in exposure categories. The detorioration is most pronounced in the frequency range mediated by Pacinian corpuscles. In this range an approximately four-fold increase of relative risk for elevated VPT for those in the highest exposure category was observed compared to the non-exposed group. Corresponding relative risk estimate for SI is about 6. Therefore, the results suggest an existence of an exposure-response relationship.},

	Abstract = {When using vibrotactile thresholds to investigate neuropathy in the fingers, the indentation of a vibrating probe, and the force applied to a static surround around a vibrating probe, affect thresholds. This study was designed to investigate the effects on vibrotactile perception thresholds at the sole of the foot of probe indentation (i.e. height of a vibrating probe relative to a static surround) and the force applied to the static surround. Thresholds at 20 Hz (expected to be mediated by the NP I channel) and at 160 Hz (expected to be mediated by the Pacinian channel) were obtained at the hallux (i.e. greater toe) and the ball of the foot on 14 healthy subjects. In one condition, the height of the vibrating probe was varied to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm above a static surround with 4-N force applied to the surround. In a second condition, the force applied to the surround was varied to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 N while using a probe height of 1mm. Thresholds at 20 Hz decreased with increasing probe height from 0 to 1 mm but showed no significant variation between 2, 3, and 4mm at either the hallux or the ball of the foot. Thresholds at 160 Hz decreased with increasing probe height from 0 to 4 mm at both the hallux and the ball of the foot. Thresholds at 20 Hz obtained with 1-N surround force were higher than thresholds obtained with 2 N, but there was no significant difference with surround forces from 2 to 6 N at either the hallux or the ball of the foot. Thresholds at 160 Hz were unaffected by variations in surround force at the ball of the foot but tended to decrease with increasing force at the hallux. It is concluded that a vibrating probe flush with a static surround, and a surround force in the range 2-4 N, are appropriate when measuring vibrotactile thresholds at the hallux and the ball of the foot with a 6-mm diameter contactor and a 2-mm gap to the static surround.},

@article{GoeblPalmer2008,
	Abstract = {Sequential actions such as playing a piano or tapping in synchrony to an external signal put high cognitive and motor demands on producers, including the generation of precise timing at a wide variety of rates. Tactile information from the fingertips has been shown to contribute to the control of timing in finger tapping tasks. We addressed the hypothesis that reduction of timing errors is related to tactile afferent information in pianists' finger movements during performance. Twelve pianists performed melodies at four rates in a synchronization-continuation paradigm. The pianists' finger motion trajectories toward the piano keys, recorded with a motion capture system, contained different types and amounts of kinematic landmarks at different performance rates. One landmark, a finger-key (FK) landmark, can occur when the finger makes initial contact with the key surface and changes its acceleration abruptly. Overall, there were more FK landmarks in the pianists' keystrokes, as the performance rate increased. The pianists were divided into two groups: those with low percentages of FK in the medium rates that increased with increasing performance rate and those with persistently high FK percentages. Low-FK pianists showed a positive relationship between increased tactile feedback from the current keystroke and increased temporal accuracy in the upcoming keystroke. These findings suggest that sensory information available at finger-key contact enhances the timing accuracy of finger movements in piano performance.},

	Abstract = {Many neural and vascular diseases in hands and fingers have been related to the degenerative responses of local neural and vascular systems in fingers to excessive dynamic loading. Since fingerpads serve as a coupling element between the hand and the objects, the investigation of the dynamic coupling between fingertip and subjects could provide important information for the understanding of the pathomechanics of these neural and vascular diseases. In the present study, the nonlinear and time-dependent force responses of fingertips during dynamic contact have been investigated experimentally and theoretically. Four subjects (2 male and 2 female) with an average age of 24 years participated in the study. The index fingers of right and left hands of each subject were compressed using a flat platen via a micro testing machine. A physical model was proposed to simulate the nonlinear and time-dependent force responses of fingertips during dynamic contact. Using a force relaxation test and a fast loading test at constant loading speed, the material/structural parameters underlying the proposed physical model could be identified. The predicted rate-dependent force/displacement curves and time-histories of force responses of fingertips were compared with those measured in the corresponding experiments. Our results suggest that the force responses of fingertips during the dynamic contacts are nonlinear and time-dependent. The physical model was verified to characterize the nonlinear, rate-dependent force-displacement behaviors, force relaxations, and time-histories of force responses of fingertips during dynamic contact.},

	Abstract = {Determining tendon tensions of the finger muscles is crucial for the understanding and the rehabilitation of hand pathologies. Since no direct measurement is possible for a large number of finger muscle tendons, biomechanical modelling presents an alternative solution to indirectly evaluate these forces. However, the main problem is that the number of muscles spanning a joint exceeds the number of degrees of freedom of the joint resulting in mathematical under-determinate problems. In the current study, a method using both numerical optimization and the intra-muscular electromyography (EMG) data was developed to estimate the middle finger tendon tensions during static fingertip force production. The method used a numerical optimization procedure with the muscle stress squared criterion to determine a solution while the EMG data of three extrinsic hand muscles serve to enforce additional inequality constraints. The results were compared with those obtained with a classical numerical optimization and a method based on EMG only. The proposed method provides satisfactory results since the tendon tension estimations respected the mechanical equilibrium of the musculoskeletal system and were concordant with the EMG distribution pattern of the subjects. These results were not observed neither with the classical numerical optimization nor with the EMG-based method. This study demonstrates that including the EMG data of the three extrinsic muscles of the middle finger as inequality constraints in an optimization process can yield relevant tendon tensions with regard to individual muscle activation patterns, particularly concerning the antagonist muscles.},

However, a loud accompaniment may mask the auditory feedback, leaving the singers to rely on kinesthetic feedback. The object of the present study was to estimate the significance of auditory and kinesthetic feedback to pitch control in 28 students beginning a professional solo singing education. The singers sang an ascending and descending triad pattern covering their entire pitch range with and without masking noise in legato and staccato and in a slow and a fast tempo. F0 was measured by means of a computer program. The interval sizes between adjacent tones were determined and their departures from equally tempered tuning were calculated. The deviations from this tuning were used as a measure of the accuracy of intonation. Statistical analysis showed a significant effect of masking that amounted to a mean impairment of pitch accuracy by 14 cent across all subjects. Furthermore, significant effects were found of tempo as well as of the staccato/legato conditions. The results indicate that auditory feedback contributes significantly to singers' control of pitch.},

	Abstract = {Touch typing movements are typically too brief to use on-line feedback. Yet, previous studies have shown that blocking tactile feedback of the fingertip of typists leads to an increase in typing errors. To determine the contribution of tactile information to rapid fine motor skills, we analyzed kinematics of the right index finger during typing with and without tactile feedback. Twelve expert touch typists copy-typed sentences on a computer keyboard without vision of their hands or the computer screen. Following control trials, their right index fingertip was anesthetized, and sentences were typed again. The movements of the finger were recorded with an instrumented glove and electromagnetic position sensor. During anesthesia, typing errors of that finger increased sevenfold. While the inter-keypress timing and average kinematics were unaffected, there was an increase in variability of all measures. Regression analysis showed that endpoint variability was largely accounted for by start location variability. The results suggest that tactile cues provide information about the start location of the finger, which is necessary to perform typing movements accurately.},

	Abstract = {The sounds produced when we touch textured surfaces frequently provide information regarding the structure of those surfaces. It has recently been demonstrated that the perception of the texture of the hands can be modified simply by manipulating the frequency content of such touch-related sounds. We investigated whether similar auditory manipulations change people's perception of the roughness of abrasive surfaces (experiment 1). Participants were required to make speeded, forced-choice discrimination responses regarding the roughness of a series of abrasive samples which they touched briefly. Analysis of discrimination errors verified that tactile roughness perception was modulated by the frequency content of the auditory feedback. Specifically, attenuating high frequencies led to a bias towards an increased perception of tactile smoothness. In experiment 2, we replicated the rubbing-hands manipulation of previous experimenters while participants rated either the perceived roughness or wetness of their hands. The wetness scale data replicated the results in the literature, while the roughness scale data replicated the result from experiment 1. A final experiment showed that delaying the auditory feedback from the hand-rubbing reduced the magnitude of this parchment-skin illusion. These experiments demonstrate the dramatic effect that auditory frequency manipulations can have on the perceived tactile roughness and moistness of surfaces, and are consistent with the proposal that different auditory perceptual dimensions may have varying salience for different surfaces.},

	Abstract = {Playing a musical instrument requires efficient auditory and motor processing. Fast feed forward and feedback connections that link the acoustic target to the corresponding motor programs need to be established during years of practice. The aim of our study is to provide a detailed description of cortical structures that participate in this audio-motor coordination network in professional pianists and non-musicians. In order to map these interacting areas using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we considered cortical areas that are concurrently activated during silent piano performance and motionless listening to piano sound. Furthermore we investigated to what extent interactions between the auditory and the motor modality happen involuntarily. We observed a network of predominantly secondary and higher order areas belonging to the auditory and motor modality. The extent of activity was clearly increased by imagination of the absent modality. However, this network did neither comprise primary auditory nor primary motor areas in any condition. Activity in the lateral dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and the pre-supplementary motor cortex (preSMA) was significantly increased for pianists. Our data imply an intermodal transformation network of auditory and motor areas which is subject to a certain degree of plasticity by means of intensive training.},

	Abstract = {Vibrotactile stimuli can facilitate hearing, both in hearing-impaired and in normally hearing people. Accordingly, the sounds of hands exploring a surface contribute to the explorer's haptic percepts. As a possible brain basis of such phenomena, functional brain imaging has identified activations specific to audiotactile interaction in secondary somatosensory cortex, auditory belt area, and posterior parietal cortex, depending on the quality and relative salience of the stimuli. We studied 13 subjects with non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to search for auditory brain areas that would be activated by touch. Vibration bursts of 200 Hz were delivered to the subjects' fingers and palm and tactile pressure pulses to their fingertips. Noise bursts served to identify auditory cortex. Vibrotactile-auditory co-activation, addressed with minimal smoothing to obtain a conservative estimate, was found in an 85-mm3 region in the posterior auditory belt area. This co-activation could be related to facilitated hearing at the behavioral level, reflecting the analysis of sound-like temporal patterns in vibration. However, even tactile pulses (without any vibration) activated parts of the posterior auditory belt area, which therefore might subserve processing of audiotactile events that arise during dynamic contact between hands and environment.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that the localization of auditory or tactile stimuli can be biased by the simultaneous presentation of a visual stimulus from a different spatial position. We investigated whether auditory localization judgments could also be affected by the presentation of spatially displaced tactile stimuli, using a procedure designed to reveal perceptual interactions across modalities. Participants made left-right discrimination responses regarding the perceived location of sounds, which were presented either in isolation or together with tactile stimulation to the fingertips. The results demonstrate that the apparent location of a sound can be biased toward tactile stimulation when it is synchronous, but not when it is asynchronous, with the auditory event. Directing attention to the tactile modality did not increase the bias of sound localization toward synchronous tactile stimulation. These results provide the first demonstration of the tactile capture of audition.},

In the first study, the multimodal quality of properties underlying children's and adults' perception was investigated. Subjects listened to solos and identified instruments producing the sounds. Even children who did not have experience with all the instruments correctly identified the family of instruments they were listening to. The hypothesis of the second study, that musical instrument families function as a "basic level" in the instrument taxonomy, was confirmed. Variation in the basic level with varying expertise was documented in the third study with musicians. In the fourth study, children and adults identified the source of sounds from unfamiliar objects, Chinese musical instruments. It is suggested that the concept of affordances may be relevant for understanding the importance for behavior of different levels of abstraction of category systems.},

@article{LloydAl:auditionTouchSpatial,
	Abstract = {We report three experiments designed to investigate the nature of any crossmodal links between audition and touch in sustained endogenous covert spatial attention, using the orthogonal spatial cuing paradigm. Participants discriminated the elevation (up vs. down) of auditory and tactile targets presented to either the left or the right of fixation. In Experiment 1, targets were expected on a particular side in just one modality; the results demonstrated that the participants could spatially shift their attention independently in both audition and touch. Experiment 2 demonstrated that when the participants were informed that targets were more likely to be on one side for both modalities, elevation judgments were faster on that side in both audition and touch. The participants were also able to ï¿½splitï¿½ their auditory and tactile attention, albeit at some cost, when targets in the two modalities were expected on opposite sides. Similar results were also reported in Experiment 3 when participants adopted a crossed-hands posture, thus revealing that crossmodal links in audiotactile attention operate on a representation of space that is updated following posture change. These results are discussed in relation to previous findings regarding crossmodal links in audiovisual and visuotactile covert spatial attentional orienting.},

@article{Bangert2003,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Performing music requires fast auditory and motor processing. Regarding professional musicians, recent brain imaging studies have demonstrated that auditory stimulation produces a co-activation of motor areas, whereas silent tapping of musical phrases evokes a co-activation in auditory regions. Whether this is obtained via a specific cerebral relay station is unclear. Furthermore, the time course of plasticity has not yet been addressed. RESULTS: Changes in cortical activation patterns (DC-EEG potentials) induced by short (20 minute) and long term (5 week) piano learning were investigated during auditory and motoric tasks. Two beginner groups were trained. The 'map' group was allowed to learn the standard piano key-to-pitch map. For the 'no-map' group, random assignment of keys to tones prevented such a map. Auditory-sensorimotor EEG co-activity occurred within only 20 minutes. The effect was enhanced after 5-week training, contributing elements of both perception and action to the mental representation of the instrument. The 'map' group demonstrated significant additional activity of right anterior regions. CONCLUSION: We conclude that musical training triggers instant plasticity in the cortex, and that right-hemispheric anterior areas provide an audio-motor interface for the mental representation of the keyboard.},

@article{Gescheider2003,
	Abstract = {The ability of observers to detect temporal gaps in bursts of sinusoids or bursts of band-limited noise was measured to assess the temporal acuity of Pacinian (P) and non-Pacinian (NP) tactile information processing channels. The P channel was isolated by delivering high frequency sinusoids or high frequency noise through a large 1.5-cm2 contactor to the thenar eminence. The NP channels were isolated from the P channel by delivering these stimuli as well as stimuli with lower frequencies through a small 0.01-cm2 contactor to the same site. Gap detection thresholds were higher for gaps in noise than for gaps in sinusoids but did not differ among conditions designed to isolate P and NP channels. The finding that temporal acuity does not differ among channels supports the hypothesis that, after termination of a stimulus, the P and NP channels exhibit the same amount of neural persistence. Also consistent with this hypothesis are the earlier findings that the enhancement of the sensation magnitude of a stimulus by a prior stimulus (Verrillo and Gescheider, Percept Psychophys 18: 128-136, 1975) and the duration of sensation after the termination of a stimulus (Gescheider et al., J Acoust Soc Am 91: 1690-1696, 1992) are independent of stimulus frequency. One important implication of this hypothesis, if true, is that the presence of temporal summation in the P channel and its absence in the NP channels, results, not from the lack of neural persistence in the NP channels, but instead, in marked contrast to the P channel, from the lack of a mechanism for integrating persistent neural activity over time.},

@article{Burstrom2009a,
	Abstract = {This study clarifies whether the established frequency weighting procedure for evaluating exposure to hand-transmitted vibration can effectively evaluate the temporary changes in vibrotactile perception thresholds due to pre-exposure to vibration. In addition, this study investigates the relationship between changes of the vibrotactile perception thresholds and the normalized energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration. The fingers of 10 healthy subjects, five male and five female, were exposed to vibration under 16 conditions with a combination of different frequencies, intensities, and exposure times. The vibration frequencies were 31.5 and 125 Hz and exposure lasted between 2 and 16 min. According to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 5349-1, the energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration for the experimental time of 16 min is 2.5 or 5.0 m s(-2) root-mean-square, corresponding to a 8-h equivalent acceleration, A(8), of approximately 0.5 and 0.9 m s(-2), respectively. A measure of the vibrotactile perception thresholds was conducted before the different exposures to vibration. Immediately after the vibration exposure, the acute effect was measured continuously on the exposed index finger for the first 75 s, followed by 30 s of measures every minute for a maximum of 10 min. If the subject's thresholds had not recovered, the measures continued for a maximum of 30 min with measurements taken every 5 min. Pre-exposure to vibration significantly influenced vibrotactile thresholds. This study concludes that the influence on the thresholds depends on the frequency of the vibration stimuli. Increased equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration resulted in a significant change in threshold, but the thresholds were unaffected when changes in the vibration magnitude were expressed as the frequency-weighted acceleration or the unweighted acceleration. Moreover, the frequency of the pre-vibration exposure significantly influenced (up to 25 min after exposure) recovery time of the vibrotactile thresholds. This study shows that the frequency weighting procedure in ISO 5349-1 is unable to predict the produced acute changes in the vibrotactile perception. Moreover, the results imply that the calculation of the 'energy-equivalent' frequency-weighted acceleration does not reflect the acute changes of the vibration perception thresholds due to pre-exposure to vibration. Furthermore, when testing for the vibrotactile thresholds, exposure to vibration on the day of a test might influence the results. Until further knowledge is obtained, the previous practice of 3 h avoidance of vibration exposure before assessment is recommended.},

@article{Zhu1997,
	Abstract = {OBJECT: To investigate whether hand-arm vibration and noise have a combined effect on temporary threshold shift (TTS) of hearing among healthy subjects. METHOD AND DESIGN: Nineteen healthy subjects with an average age of 25.7 (SD 7.7) years were exposed to vibration (30 m/s2, 60 Hz), noise [90 dB(A)] and both, respectively. The subject's right hand was placed on the plate of a vibrator and the right ear exposed to noise via headphones. Subjects were exposed to vibration and/or noise for 3 min and after a 1-min pause the exposure was repeated five times. Hearing thresholds at 1, 4 and 6 kHz were measured during the time periods before, between (during pauses) and after exposure. RESULTS: Exposure to vibration alone caused almost no hearing threshold changes at every frequency tested. But exposure to noise or a combination of vibration and noise caused a significant increase in TTSs at 4 and 6 kHz. Moreover, exposure to a combination of vibration and noise caused significantly higher TTSs than exposure to noise at 4 and 6 kHz. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate the combined effects of hand-arm vibration and noise can enhance exposure to hand-arm vibration and noise can enhance the TTS of hearing more than noise exposure, though hand-arm vibration alone may hardly affect TTS.},

	Abstract = {To study the effects of touch on auditory processing, we examined whether uninformative and irrelevant tactile stimuli presented together with task-relevant sounds can improve auditory detection (Experiment 1), and enhance perceived loudness (Experiment 2). We demonstrated that irrelevant tactile signals facilitate the detection of faint tones, and increase auditory intensity ratings. These crossmodal facilitation effects were found for synchronous when compared to asynchronous auditory-tactile stimulation, and were stronger for weaker than for louder sounds. They are interpreted in terms of a multisensory integration mechanism that increases the strength of auditory signals, and adheres to the rules of inverse effectiveness and temporal (but not spatial) co-occurrence. This integration might be mediated by auditory-tactile multisensory neurons in regions of auditory association cortex that are also involved in auditory detection and loudness discrimination.},

@article{Fritz2012a,
	Abstract = {Most violinists believe that instruments by Stradivari and Guarneri "del Gesu" are tonally superior to other violins--and to new violins in particular. Many mechanical and acoustical factors have been proposed to account for this superiority; however, the fundamental premise of tonal superiority has not yet been properly investigated. Player's judgments about a Stradivari's sound may be biased by the violin's extraordinary monetary value and historical importance, but no studies designed to preclude such biasing factors have yet been published. We asked 21 experienced violinists to compare violins by Stradivari and Guarneri del Gesu with high-quality new instruments. The resulting preferences were based on the violinists' individual experiences of playing the instruments under double-blind conditions in a room with relatively dry acoustics. We found that (i) the most-preferred violin was new; (ii) the least-preferred was by Stradivari; (iii) there was scant correlation between an instrument's age and monetary value and its perceived quality; and (iv) most players seemed unable to tell whether their most-preferred instrument was new or old. These results present a striking challenge to conventional wisdom. Differences in taste among individual players, along with differences in playing qualities among individual instruments, appear more important than any general differences between new and old violins. Rather than searching for the "secret" of Stradivari, future research might best focused on how violinists evaluate instruments, on which specific playing qualities are most important to them, and on how these qualities relate to measurable attributes of the instruments, whether old or new.},

@article{Shima2009,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a method of estimating fingertip forces in finger tapping movements based on human fingerpad characteristics. Since the human fingerpad exhibits elasticity, the proposed technique recreates the relationship between the fingertip force and the displacement generated between the thumb and index fingerpads as a fingerpad-stiffness model. Then, using this model, the force between the two fingertips (the fingertip force) can be estimated from the measured fingerpad deformation only. As the method does not require any sensors to be attached to the finger contact surface to measure fingertip force, it can be used to evaluate the tendency of force in natural and unconstrained finger tapping movements conducted by the subject. In the experiments conducted, fingertip forces and the displacement of the two fingerpads generated when the subjects pinched and pushed a force sensor with the thumb and index finger were measured to approximate the relationships between fingerpad force and deformation. The results indicated that human fingerpad characteristics can be expressed using a fingerpad-stiffness function (including an exponential function), and that fingerpad forces can be estimated using the proposed model. Furthermore, comparison between a Parkinson's disease (PD) patient and a healthy subject confirmed differences in the finger tapping forces for each. This implies the possibility of assessing motor function in PD patients using the finger tapping force evaluation method proposed in this paper.},

@article{GescheiderAl1990:VibrIntensity,
	Abstract = {The difference threshold for the detection of changes in vibration amplitude was measured as a function of the intensity and frequency of stimuli delivered through a 2.9-cm2 contactor to the thenar eminence. Stimuli were either 25- or 250-Hz sinusoids, narrow-band noise centered at 250 Hz, or wideband noise. Thresholds were measured by two-interval, forced-choice tracking under three methods of stimulus presentation. In the gated-pedestal method, subjects had to judge which of two 700-ms bursts of vibration separated by 100 ms was more intense. In the continuous-pedestal method, subjects had to detect a 700-ms increment in the amplitude of an ongoing pedestal of vibration. In the two-burst-continuous-pedestal method with 1500-ms pedestals, the subject had to detect which of two successively presented pedestals contained a 500-ms amplitude increment. Thresholds were consistently lower for detecting increments in the amplitude of a continuous pedestal of vibration than for detecting amplitude differences between briefly presented successive pedestals or amplitude increments in successive pedestals. A "near miss" to Weber's law was found both for sinusoidal and for noise stimuli. The difference threshold was not affected by stimulus frequency condition.},

@article{Vega-Bermudez1991a,
	Abstract = {1. Subjects without any previous experience in a tactile psychophysics task participated in a study of tactile letter recognition employing active and passive touch. In the active task, subjects reached through a curtain and examined embossed letters with horizontal, unidirectional finger strokes. In the passive task, subjects sat with their arms and hands immobilized while a rotating drum stimulator pressed the embossed letters onto the right index finger. The stimulus conditions in the passive task were identical to those used in neurophysiological experiments with monkeys. 2. A survey of 40 naive subjects who were not screened in any way showed a wide range of performance levels. There was no difference between the subjects in the active and passive tasks, either in overall mean percent correct scores, which were 49.0 and 50.7\%, respectively or in the percent correct scores for individual letters whose product-moment correlation coefficient was 0.94. The active and passive groups, which contained 25 and 15 members, respectively, had no members in common. 3. Videotapes of the finger movements of eight subjects in the active task showed a characteristic V-shaped velocity profile (velocity vs. lateral position) starting at approximately 100 mm/s at the left-hand edge of the plate containing the embossed letter, decelerating to a minimum when the center of the finger was directly over the letter, and then accelerating away from the letter. The average minimum scanning velocity was 17 mm/s. 4. Scanning velocity had no significant effect on performance in the passive task between 20 and 40 mm/s. An increase to 80 mm/s produced a 16\% decline in percent correct identifications. 5. Learning effects were evident across sessions even though subjects were given no feedback or training. The increase in mean percent correct judgments averaged 4\% per session, which lasted for approximately 1 h. 6. Data from 64 subjects were pooled for detailed comparison of identification patterns in active and passive touch. The results were analyzed and found to be consistent with the hypothesis that the identification and confusion probabilities are identical in the two modes. We conclude that there is no difference between active and passive touch in form recognition when the stimulus pattern is smaller than a finger pad. 7. Data from all experiments were pooled to produce a single confusion matrix with 324 presentations per letter. The majority of erroneous responses are grouped in a small number of confusion pairs and the majority of those confusion pairs are strongly asymmetric. The probable neural mechanisms of some confusion patterns are discussed.},

@article{Vines2011,
	Abstract = {We investigate non-verbal communication through expressive body movement and musical sound, to reveal higher cognitive processes involved in the integration of emotion from multiple sensory modalities. Participants heard, saw, or both heard and saw recordings of a Stravinsky solo clarinet piece, performed with three distinct expressive styles: restrained, standard, and exaggerated intention. Participants used a 5-point Likert scale to rate each performance on 19 different emotional qualities. The data analysis revealed that variations in expressive intention had their greatest impact when the performances could be seen; the ratings from participants who could only hear the performances were the same across the three expressive styles. Evidence was also found for an interaction effect leading to an emergent property, intensity of positive emotion, when participants both heard and saw the musical performances. An exploratory factor analysis revealed orthogonal dimensions for positive and negative emotions, which may account for the subjective experience that many listeners report of having multi-valent or complex reactions to music, such as "bittersweet."},

@article{Loehr2007,
	Abstract = {Movement sequences such as typing or tapping display important interactions among finger movements arising from anticipatory motion (preparing for upcoming events) and coupling (non-independence among fingers). We examined pianists' finger tapping for the influence of cognitive chunking processes and biomechanical coupling constraints. In a synchronization-continuation task, pianists repeatedly tapped four-finger sequences that differed in terms of the chunks that formed subsequences and in the transitions among physically adjacent or non-adjacent fingers. Chunking influenced intertap intervals, regardless of the particular fingers tapped; the final tap of each chunk was lengthened and less variable relative to other taps. The particular fingers tapped influenced peak finger heights, consistency of motion, and velocity-acceleration patterns, regardless of chunking. Thus, cognitive constraints influenced timing, whereas biomechanical factors influenced motion trajectories. These findings provide an important caveat for study of anticipatory motion by documenting the influence of biomechanical coupling on motion trajectories.},

@article{GescheiderAl:VibTempSum,
	Abstract = {Temporal summation, a decrease in the detection threshold that occurs when either the duration of a stimulus or the number of stimuli in a sequence is increased, has been attributed to the operations of either the mechanism of neural integration or of probability summation. Our experiments indicate that under certain conditions, both mechanisms may operate, but that the process of neural integration is an exclusive characteristic of the Pacinian (P) channel. The P channel was isolated by applying 250 Hz stimuli through a 1.5 cm2 contactor to the thenar eminence of the hand and the NPII channel was isolated by applying the stimuli through a 0.01 cm2 contactor. The finding that the slopes of the psychometric functions were the same within both channels indicated that probability summation could not account for temporal summation for stimulus durations less than 1 s. The finding that the threshold for the detection of multiple-pulse stimuli increased as the interpulse interval increased indicated that, for time intervals less than 800 ms, temporal summation results from neural integration. But for interstimulus intervals greater than 800 ms, probability summation accounts for temporal summation.},

@article{Vines2006,
	Abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of sensory integration for perceiving musical performance, a complex natural behavior. Thirty musically trained participants saw, heard, or both saw and heard, performances by two clarinetists. All participants used a sliding potentiometer to make continuous judgments of tension (a measure correlated with emotional response) and continuous judgments of phrasing (a measure correlated with perceived musical structure) as performances were presented. The data analysis sought to reveal relations between the sensory modalities (vision and audition) and to quantify the effect of seeing the performances on participants' overall subjective experience of the music. In addition to traditional statistics, functional data analysis techniques were employed to analyze time-varying aspects of the data. The auditory and visual channels were found to convey similar experiences of phrasing but different experiences of tension through much of the performances. We found that visual information served both to augment and to reduce the experience of tension at different points in the musical piece (as revealed by functional linear modeling and functional significance testing). In addition, the musicians' movements served to extend the sense of phrasing, to cue the beginning of new phrases, to indicate musical interpretation, and to anticipate changes in emotional content. Evidence for an interaction effect suggests that there may exist an emergent quality when musical performances are both seen and heard. The investigation augments knowledge of human communicative processes spanning language and music, and involving multiple modalities of emotion and information transfer.},

@article{Biswas2015,
	Abstract = {Based on recent discoveries of stretch and voltage activated ion channels in the receptive area of the Pacinian Corpuscle (PC), this paper describes a two-stage mechanotransduction model of its near threshold Vibrotactile (VT) sensitivity valid over 10 Hz to a few kHz. The model is based on the nonlinear and stochastic behavior of the ion channels represented as dependent charge sources loaded with membrane impedance. It simulates the neural response of the PC considering the morphological and statistical properties of the receptor potential and action potential with the help of an adaptive relaxation pulse frequency modulator. This model also simulates the plateaus and nonmonotonic saturation of spike rate characteristics. The stochastic simulation based on the addition of mechanical and neural noise describes that the VT Sensitivity Threshold (VTST) at higher frequencies is more noise dependent. Above 800 Hz even a SNR = 150 improves the neurophysiological VTST more than 3 dB$\mu$. In that frequency range, an absence of the entrainment threshold and a lower sensitivity index near the absolute threshold make the upper bound of the psychophysical VTST more dependent on the experimental protocol and physical set-up. This model can be extended to simulate the neural response of a group of PCs.},

	Abstract = {Tactile feedback enhances the usability and enjoyment of human-computer interfaces. Many feedback techniques have been devised to present tactile stimuli corresponding to a user's hand movements taking account of the concept of active touch. However, hand movements may not necessarily be required for achieving natural tactile feedback. Here, we propose a virtual-active-touch method that achieves haptic perception without actual/direct hand movements. In this method, a cursor manipulated by a force-input device is regarded as a virtual finger of the operator on the screen. Tactile feedback is provided to the operator in accordance with cursor movements. To validate the translation of virtual roughness gratings, we compare the virtual-active-touch interface with an interface that involves actual hand movements. By using the appropriate force-to-velocity gain for the pointing-stick interface, we show that the virtual-active-touch method presents the surface wavelengths of the gratings, which is a fundamental property for texture roughness, and that the gain significantly influences the textures experienced by the operators. Furthermore, we find that the perceived wavelengths of objects scaled and viewed on a small screen are skewed. We conclude that although some unique problems remain to be solved, we may be able to perceive the surface wavelengths solely with the intentions of active touch through virtual-active-touch interfaces.},

	Abstract = {This article addresses the problem of producing independent tactile stimuli to multiple fingers exploring a transparent solid surface without the need to track their positions. To this end, wave time-reversal was applied to re-focus displacement impulses in time and in space at one or several locations in a thin glass plate. This result was achieved using ultrasonic bending waves produced by a set of lamellar piezoelectric actuators bonded at the periphery of the plate. Starting from first principles, the relations linking implementatin pËarameters to the performance of the display are developed. The mechanical design of the display, signal processing and driving electronics are described. A set of engineering tradeoffs are made explicit and used for the design of a mock up device comprising a glass plate 148 Ã 210 Ã 0.5 mm. Tests indicate that a peak amplitude of 7 m confined to a 20 mm2 region could be obtained for an average power consumption of 45 mW. Simultaneous focusing at several locations was successfully achieved. We showed that a lumped-mass model for the fingertip can effectively describe the effect of an actual fingertip load at the focus point. Lastly, we elucidated a likely stimulation mechanism that involves the transient decoupling of the finger skin from the plate surface. This phenomenon explains the observed tactile effect.},

@article{Juravle2013,
	Abstract = {Tactile perception is inhibited during movement execution, a phenomenon known as tactile suppression. Here, we investigated whether the type of movement determines whether or not this form of sensory suppression occurs. Participants performed simple reaching or exploratory movements. Tactile discrimination thresholds were calculated for vibratory stimuli delivered to participants' wrists while executing the movement, and while at rest (a tactile discrimination task, TD). We also measured discrimination performance in a same vs. different task for the explored materials during the execution of the different movements (a surface discrimination task, SD). The TD and SD tasks could either be performed singly or together, both under active movement and passive conditions. Consistent with previous results, tactile thresholds measured at rest were significantly lower than those measured during both active movement and passive touch (that is, tactile suppression was observed). Moreover, SD performance was significantly better under conditions of single-tasking, active movements, as well as exploratory movements, as compared to conditions of dual-tasking, passive movements, and reaching movements, respectively. Therefore, the present results demonstrate that when active hand movements are made with the purpose of gaining information about the surface properties of different materials an enhanced perceptual performance is observed. As such, it would appear that tactile suppression occurs for irrelevant tactual features during both reaching and exploratory movements, but not for those task-relevant features that result from action execution during tactile exploration. Taken together, then, these results support a context-dependent modulation of tactile suppression during movement execution.},

For example, your attention might be attracted by somebody touching your hand or, if you are the one trying to attract attention, you will feel the touch contact. In everyday usage, the term does not distinguish between stimulation imposed on us and stimulation that results from our own intentional movement. In this review we consider the nature of touch. However, in our use of the term we include not only skin sensation but also proprioceptive sensation arising in sensory receptors in the muscles (the term "haptics" is sometimes used to refer to the combination of skin and muscle sensory input). We compare and contrast touch that is "passive" (when you are the recipient) and "active" (when your movement is the cause). Our purpose is twofold. First, we seek to describe current understanding of the neurophysiology of a key sensory system. Second, we wish to show how a psychological approach helps us to understand the use of touch information and, to that extent, put the neurophysiology in context.},

@article{Chapman1994,
	Abstract = {Active and passive touch, respectively with and without voluntary movement on the part of the subject, are frequently reported to be equivalent in terms of the resultant perceptual abilities. This review reexamines the notion of perceptual equivalence in the light of growing evidence that the transmission of tactile inputs is diminished, or "gated," during the course of active movement. It is concluded that there is indeed gating of cutaneous inputs during active touch. In most experiments, the paradoxical observation of perceptual equivalence between active and passive touch can partly be explained by the choice of task, namely, tactile discriminations that depend on relative, and not absolute, differences in inputs. The surprising lack of evidence for any superiority of passive touch over active touch can likely be explained by several factors. First, performance with active touch may be enhanced by the motor strategy, e.g., by reducing the speed of movement at critical points, and so reducing the degree of gating, and (or) by optimally orienting the exploring digits so as to bring the most sensitive skin areas into contact with the object in question. Second, central influences, including attention and motor set, may be specifically activated during voluntary movement and contribute to enhancing performance during active touch. Thus, the gating influences associated with active touch may be offset, partly or wholly, by the combined influence of these factors to yield (near) perceptual equivalence for active and passive touch.},

	Abstract = {The neural mechanisms behind active and passive touch are not yet fully understood. Using fMRI we investigated the brain correlates of these exploratory procedures using a roughness categorization task. Participants either actively explored a surface (active touch) or the surface was moved under the participant's stationary finger (passive touch). The stimuli consisted of three different grades of sandpaper which participants were required to categorize as either coarse, medium, or fine. Exploratory procedure did not affect performance although the coarse and fine surfaces were more easily categorized than the medium surface. An initial whole brain analysis revealed activation of sensory and cognitive areas, including post-central gyrus and prefrontal cortical areas, in line with areas reported in previous studies. Our main analysis revealed greater activation during active than passive touch in the contralateral primary somatosensory region but no effect of stimulus roughness. In contrast, activation in the parietal operculum (OP) was significantly affected by stimulus roughness but not by exploration procedure. Active touch also elicited greater and more distributed brain activity compared with passive touch in areas outside the somatosensory region, possibly due to the motor component of the task. Our results reveal that different cortical areas may be involved in the processing of surface exploration and surface texture, with exploration procedures affecting activations in the primary somatosensory cortex and stimulus properties affecting relatively higher cortical areas within the somatosensory system.},

	Abstract = {Brisben, A. J., S. S. Hsiao, and K. O. Johnson. Detection of vibration transmitted through an object grasped in the hand. A tool or probe often functions as an extension of the hand, transmitting vibrations to the hand to produce a percept of the object contacting the tool or probe. This paper reports the psychophysical results of a combined psychophysical and neurophysiological study of the perception of vibration transmitted through a cylinder grasped in the hand. In the first part of the psychophysical study, 19 subjects grasped a cylinder, 32 mm diam, with an embedded motor that caused vibration parallel to the axis of the cylinder. The relationship between threshold and frequency was the traditional U-shaped function with a minimum between 150 and 200 Hz. Except a study by Bekesy in which subjects grasped a rod that vibrated parallel to the skin surface, thresholds above 20 Hz were lower and the slopes were steeper than any reported previously. Thresholds were <0.01 \{micro\}m in some subjects. Data from both the psychophysical and the neurophysiological studies suggest that detection performance at frequencies >20 Hz was based on activity in Pacinian afferents. The extreme sensitivity compared with previous reports may have resulted from differences in contact area, direction of vibration, contact force, and the shape of the stimulus probe. The effects of each of these variables were studied. At 40 and 300 Hz (frequencies near the lower and upper end of the Pacinian range) thresholds were 9.8 and 18.5 dB (68 and 88\%) lower, respectively, when subjects grasped the cylinder than when a 1-mm-diam probe vibrated perpendicular to the skin. These differences were accounted for as follows: 1) thresholds at a single fingerpad obtained with the large cylindrical surface were, on average, 20 and 60\% lower, respectively, than thresholds with the punctate probe; 2) thresholds at the palm were, on average, 15 and 40\% lower, respectively, than at the fingerpads; 3) thresholds obtained when the subjects grasped the cylinder averaged 40 and 20\% less, respectively, than when the cylinder contacted only the palm; 4) thresholds with the cylinder contacting two fingers were 10 and 30\% lower, respectively, than thresholds with the cylinder contacting a single finger; and 5) thresholds with vibration parallel to the skin surface were, on average, 10 and 30\% lower, respectively, than thresholds with vibration perpendicular to the skin. Contact force, which was varied from 0.05 to 1.0 N, had no effect.},

@article{Robles-De-La-Torre2001,
	Abstract = {Haptic (touch) perception normally entails an active exploration of object surfaces over time. This is called active touch. When exploring the shape of an object, we experience both geometrical and force cues. For example, when sliding a finger across a surface with a rigid bump on it, the finger moves over the bump while being opposed by a force whose direction and magnitude are related to the slope of the bump. The steeper the bump, the stronger the resistance. Geometrical and force cues are correlated, but it has been commonly assumed that shape perception relies on object geometry alone. Here we show that regardless of surface geometry, subjects identified and located shape features on the basis of force cues or their correlates. Using paradoxical stimuli, for example combining the force cues of a bump with the geometry of a hole, we found that subjects perceived a bump. Conversely, when combining the force cues of a hole with the geometry of a bump, subjects typically perceived a hole.},

	Abstract = {Active, self-touch and the passive touch from an external source engage comparable afferent mechanoreceptors on the touched skin site. However, touch directed to glabrous skin compared to hairy skin will activate different types of afferent mechanoreceptors. Despite perceptual similarities between touch to different body sites, it is likely that the touch information is processed differently. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the cortical differences in the neural signal of touch representations during active, self-touch and passive touch from another, to both glabrous (palm) and hairy (arm) skin, where a soft brush was used as the stimulus. There were two active touch conditions, where the participant used the brush in their right hand to stroke either their left palm or arm. There were two similar passive, touch conditions where the experimenter used an identical brush to stroke the same palm and arm areas on the participant. Touch on the left palm elicited a large, significant, positive blood-oxygenation level dependence (BOLD) signal in right sensorimotor areas. Less extensive activity was found for touch to the arm. Separate somatotopical palm and arm representations were found in Brodmann area (BA) 3 of the right primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and in both these areas, active stroking gave significantly higher signals than passive stroking. Active, self-touch elicited a positive BOLD signal in a network of sensorimotor cortical areas in the left hemisphere, compared to the resting baseline. In contrast, during passive touch, a significant negative BOLD signal was found in the left SI. Thus, each of the four conditions had a unique cortical signature despite similarities in afferent signaling or evoked perception. It is hypothesized that attentional mechanisms play a role in the modulation of the touch signal in the right SI, accounting for the differences found between active and passive touch.},

The task consisted in pressing the fingertip against a flat rigid surface which provided broadband vibration noise of varying amplitude. Three force levels were considered, ranging from light touch to hard press. Possibly due to the concurrent effect of large contact area, spectrally complex stimuli and active pressing force, the measured sensitivity thresholds are considerably lower than what is found in most of the previous literature. Moreover, significant differences in thresholds were found between the lowest and middle force level, and the highest and middle force level.},

At each trial, which consisted in playing loud and long A notes across the whole keyboard, vibrations were either present or absent through setting the Disklavier pianos to normal or quiet mode. Sound feedback was always pro- vided by a MIDI controlled piano synthesizer via isolating ear/headphones, which masked the acoustic sound in nor- mal mode. In partial disagreement with the existing liter- ature, our results suggest that significant vibrotactile cues are produced in the lower range of the piano keyboard, with perceptual cut-off around the middle octave.

	Abstract = {A series of experiments are described in which magnitude estimates of the perceived size of steel balls were made when the balls were actively rolled between the fingertip and several other body sites (thumb, thenar eminence, forearm). This movement, called scripting, involves actively moving an object by a touching surface over another surface of the body which is passively being touched. We define this active/passive activity as "intra-active touch" and the results show that the perceptual size of the balls is dependent upon the body part passively being activated. An additional series of experiments decoupled the actively generated and passively received tactile information by having subjects either perform the scripting on another individual's body site or by having the other individual roll the balls on the subject's various sites. The latter experiments showed that the passive body can contribute to the overall impression of the size of the balls, but only when the intra-active touching involved the glabrous skin of the hands. Intra-active touch between the active finger and the passively touched hairy skin of the forearm showed no effect of the touched surface on the perceived size of the balls. The results suggest that the mechanisms of intra-active touch are different when glabrous skin activates glabrous skin than when glabrous skin activates hairy skin. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {This article systematically explores cue integration within active touch. Our research builds upon a recently made distinction between position and force cues for haptic shape perception [Robles-de-la-Torre, G., Hayward, V., 2001. Force can overcome object geometry in the perception of shape through active touch, Nature 412, 445-448]: when sliding a finger across a bumpy surface, the finger follows the surface geometry (position cue). At the same time, the finger is exposed to forces related to the slope of the surface (force cue). Experiment 1 independently varied force and position cues to the curvature of 3D arches. Perceived curvature could be well described as a weighted average of the two cues. Experiment 2 found more weight of the position cue for more convex high arches and higher weight of the force cue for less convex shallow arches-probably mediated through a change in relative cue reliability. Both findings are in good agreement with the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) model for cue integration and, thus, carry this model over to the domain of active haptic perception. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Tomassini2014,
	Abstract = {The link between time perception and action has attracted special interest in recent years and it is progressively disclosing a multifaceted nature. A large set of temporal effects variously associated to the execution of actions has been documented (Haggard et al., 2002; Hagura et al., 2012; Tomassini et al., 2012; Yarrow et al., 2001), suggesting that perceived time may directly emerge from sensory-motor processes. Saccadic eye movements have been shown to cause not only compression of the visual space towards the saccadic target, but also a compression of time. Apparent event time is both shifted and compressed so that the temporal separation of two visual stimuli is strongly reduced and even their order of appearance sometimes reversed. The spatial and temporal distortions are thought to be interconnected phenomena that might be related to the problem of maintaining perceptual stability during eye movements (Burr \& Morrone, 2012; Cicchini et al., 2013). Interestingly, evidence suggests that similar phenomena may occur around the time of hand movements, when brief tactile stimuli are systematically mislocalized in the direction of the movement. In this study we measured whether hand movements also cause an alteration of the perceived timing of the tactile signals. Participants compared the temporal separation between two pairs of tactile taps while moving their right hand in response to an auditory cue. The first pair of tactile taps was presented at variable times with respect to movement with a fixed onset asynchrony of 150ms. 2 s after test presentation - when the hand was stationary- the second pair of taps was delivered with a variable temporal separation. Tactile stimuli could be delivered either to the right moving or left stationary hand. We found that when the tactile stimuli were presented on the motor effector, their perceived temporal separation was reduced. The compression of time began in stationary conditions, during the motor preparatory period, and persisted during movement. Critically, at the moments around action initiation, time compression was restricted to the motor effector. Duration was misjudged only when tactile stimuli were delivered to the hand that was about to move and not when delivered to the other, stationary hand. That time compression is effector-specific makes highly implausible any explanation based on high-level attentional modulations. Rather, it points to a specific mechanism based on a finely-tuned sensory-motor coupling. To understand better the nature and origin of the temporal distortion accompanying hand movements we tested also an isometric condition. Motor efference, with no associated spatial displacement of any body part, induced comparable compression of perceived time as actual movement. An intention-to-move signal, seems thus to be sufficient to mediate the observed perceptual effects. Our result corroborates recent evidence of a tight link between time perception and action and shows a selective and anticipatory movement-related distortion of time. The changes in apparent time that we observed for tactile stimuli at the moment of hand movements closely resemble the peri-saccadic distortions of visual time. As for vision, the mislocalizations of time and space of touch stimuli may be consequences of a mechanism attempting to achieve perceptual stability, suggesting that different sensorimotor systems may exploit similar strategies during the active exploration of the environment.},

The goal of the conference was to bring together an interdisciplinary group of neuroscientists, roboticists, and theorists to discuss the extent and implications of action-perception integration in the brain. The motivation for the conference was the realization that it is a widespread approach in biological, theoretical, and computational neuroscience to investigate sensory and motor function of the brain in isolation from one another, while at the same time, it is generally appreciated that sensory and motor processing cannot be fully separated. Our article summarizes the key findings of the conference, provides a hypothetical model that integrates the major themes and concepts presented at the conference, and concludes with a perspective on future challenges in the field.},

How is the repeated demonstration of active-passive equivalence in perceptual sensitivity to felt texture to be interpreted? What does such equivalence imply about the source(s) of information used to make perceptual judgements of texture? What sort of perceptual subsystem is organized to recover texture by touch? What is the role played by the action system in this recovery? The seminal observations of David Katz and J.J. Gibson are recounted and contemporary research is described. Several unresolved issues are outlined, as are several approaches by which the availability and utilization of information within this particular perceptual-action subsystem can be empirically studied.},

	Abstract = {It is generally accepted that augmented feedback, provided by a human expert or a technical display, effectively enhances motor learning. However, discussion of the way to most effectively provide augmented feedback has been controversial. Related studies have focused primarily on simple or artificial tasks enhanced by visual feedback. Recently, technical advances have made it possible also to investigate more complex, realistic motor tasks and to implement not only visual, but also auditory, haptic, or multimodal augmented feedback. The aim of this review is to address the potential of augmented unimodal and multimodal feedback in the framework of motor learning theories. The review addresses the reasons for the different impacts of feedback strategies within or between the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and the challenges that need to be overcome to provide appropriate feedback in these modalities, either in isolation or in combination. Accordingly, the design criteria for successful visual, auditory, haptic, and multimodal feedback are elaborated.},

@article{Suzuki2008,
	Abstract = {We report two psychophysical experiments designed to investigate the effects of non touch-produced sounds on the tactile perception of roughness and length. Previous studies have demonstrated that the tactile roughness perception of object surfaces is modified by sounds elicited by rubbing the surfaces. In this study, we examined the crossmodal effects of non touch-produced sounds such as white noise (Experiment 1) and pure tones (Experiment 2). Participants touched abrasive paper, synchronizing their touch with changes in the intensity of sounds or with the onset of beeps (control condition), and judged the tactile roughness or length of the stimuli, using the magnitude estimation method. Although the white noise (complex sound) significantly decreased the slope of the roughness estimation function, it did not affect that of the length estimation function. Pure tones had no effect on roughness or length perception. The results revealed that complex sounds selectively affected tactile roughness perception, even when they were seemingly irrelevant to the exploration of the surfaces. We suggest that the processing of complex sounds may be related to the processing of tactile roughness, whereas it is independent of tactile length processing.},

	Abstract = {Human superior temporal sulcus (STS) is thought to be a key brain area for multisensory integration. Many neuroimaging studies have reported integration of auditory and visual information in STS but less is known about the role of STS in integrating other sensory modalities. In macaque STS, the superior temporal polysensory area (STP) responds to somatosensory, auditory and visual stimulation. To determine if human STS contains a similar area, we measured brain responses to somatosensory, auditory and visual stimuli using blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI). An area in human posterior STS, STSms (multisensory), responded to stimulation in all three modalities. STSms responded during both active and passive presentation of unisensory somatosensory stimuli and showed larger responses for more intense vs. less intense tactile stimuli, hand vs. foot, and contralateral vs. ipsilateral tactile stimulation. STSms showed responses of similar magnitude for unisensory tactile and auditory stimulation, with an enhanced response to simultaneous auditory-tactile stimulation. We conclude that STSms is important for integrating information from the somatosensory as well as the auditory and visual modalities, and could be the human homolog of macaque STP.},

	Abstract = {The finding of a multisensory representation of actions in a premotor area of the monkey brain suggests that similar multimodal action-matching mechanisms may also be present in humans. Based on the existence of an audiovisual mirror system, we investigated whether sounds referring to actions that can be performed by the perceiver underlie different processing in the human brain. We recorded multichannel ERPs in a visuoauditory version of the repetition suppression paradigm to study the time course and the locus of the semantic processing of action-related sounds. Results show that the left posterior superior temporal and premotor areas are selectively modulated by action-related sounds; in contrast, the temporal pole is bilaterally modulated by non-action-related sounds. The present data, which support the hypothesis of distinctive action sound processing, may contribute to recent theories about the evolution of human language from a mirror system precursor.},

@article{Schulz2003,
	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare multimodal information processing in the somatosensory and auditory cortices and related multimodal areas in musicians (trumpet players) and non-musicians. Magnetoencephalographic activity (MEG) was recorded in response to five stimulus conditions from 10 professional trumpet players and nine musically untrained control subjects. Somatosensory and auditory stimuli were presented alone or in combination. Our data suggest that musicians, in general, process multisensory stimuli differently to the control group. When stimulating the lip in professional trumpet players, a multimodal interaction (expressed as difference between the multimodal response and the sum of unimodal responses) in the corresponding somatosensory cortex showed a positive peak at 33 ms, which was not found in the control group. Conversely, the control group shows a significant interaction of opposite polarity around 60-80 ms. We suggest that training-induced reorganization in musicians leads to a qualitatively different way to process multisensory information. It favors an early stage of cortical processing, which is modified by the connections between multimodal and auditory neurons from thalamus to primary somatosensory area.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the effect of musical expertise on sensitivity to asynchrony for drumming point-light displays, which varied in their physical characteristics (Experiment 1) or in their degree of audiovisual congruency (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, 21 repetitions of three tempos x three accents x nine audiovisual delays were presented to four jazz drummers and four novices. In Experiment 2, ten repetitions of two audiovisual incongruency conditions x nine audiovisual delays were presented to 13 drummers and 13 novices. Participants gave forced-choice judgments of audiovisual synchrony. The results of Experiment 1 show an enhancement in experts' ability to detect asynchrony, especially for slower drumming tempos. In Experiment 2 an increase in sensitivity to asynchrony was found for incongruent stimuli; this increase, however, is attributable only to the novice group. Altogether the results indicated that through musical practice we learn to ignore variations in stimulus characteristics that otherwise would affect our multisensory integration processes.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the effect of varying sound intensity on the audiotactile crossmodal dynamic capture effect. Participants had to discriminate the direction of a target stream (tactile, Experiment 1; auditory, Experiment 2) while trying to ignore the direction of a distractor stream presented in a different modality (auditory, Experiment 1; tactile, Experiment 2). The distractor streams could either be spatiotemporally congruent or incongruent with respect to the target stream. In half of the trials, the participants were presented with auditory stimuli at 75 dB(A) while in the other half of the trials they were presented with auditory stimuli at 82 dB(A). Participants' performance on both tasks was significantly affected by the intensity of the sounds. Namely, the crossmodal capture of tactile motion by audition was stronger with the more intense (vs. less intense) auditory distractors (Experiment 1), whereas the capture effect exerted by the tactile distractors was stronger for less intense (than for more intense) auditory targets (Experiment 2). The crossmodal dynamic capture was larger in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2, with a stronger congruency effect when the target streams were presented in the tactile (vs. auditory) modality. Two explanations are put forward to account for these results: an attentional biasing toward the more intense auditory stimuli, and a modulation induced by the relative perceptual weight of, respectively, the auditory and the tactile signals.},

	Abstract = {We report two experiments designed to assess the consequences of posture change on audiotactile spatiotemporal interactions. In Experiment 1, participants had to discriminate the direction of an auditory stream (consisting of the sequential presentation of two tones from different spatial positions) while attempting to ignore a task-irrelevant tactile stream (consisting of the sequential presentation of two vibrations, one to each of the participant's hands). The tactile stream presented to the participants' hands was either spatiotemporally congruent or incongruent with respect to the sounds. A significant decrease in performance in incongruent trials compared with congruent trials was demonstrated when the participants adopted an uncrossed-hands posture but not when their hands were crossed over the midline. In Experiment 2, we investigated the ability of participants to discriminate the direction of two sequentially presented tactile stimuli (one presented to each hand) as a function of the presence of congruent vs incongruent auditory distractors. Here, the crossmodal effect was stronger in the crossed-hands posture than in the uncrossed-hands posture. These results demonstrate the reciprocal nature of audiotactile interactions in spatiotemporal processing, and highlight the important role played by body posture in modulating such crossmodal interactions.},

@article{Wilson2010,
	Abstract = {Perceptual integration of vibrotactile and auditory sinusoidal tone pulses was studied in detection experiments as a function of stimulation frequency. Vibrotactile stimuli were delivered through a single channel vibrator to the left middle fingertip. Auditory stimuli were presented diotically through headphones in a background of 50 dB sound pressure level broadband noise. Detection performance for combined auditory-tactile presentations was measured using stimulus levels that yielded 63\% to 77\% correct unimodal performance. In Experiment 1, the vibrotactile stimulus was 250 Hz and the auditory stimulus varied between 125 and 2000 Hz. In Experiment 2, the auditory stimulus was 250 Hz and the tactile stimulus varied between 50 and 400 Hz. In Experiment 3, the auditory and tactile stimuli were always equal in frequency and ranged from 50 to 400 Hz. The highest rates of detection for the combined-modality stimulus were obtained when stimulating frequencies in the two modalities were equal or closely spaced (and within the Pacinian range). Combined-modality detection for closely spaced frequencies was generally consistent with an algebraic sum model of perceptual integration; wider-frequency spacings were generally better fit by a Pythagorean sum model. Thus, perceptual integration of auditory and tactile stimuli at near-threshold levels appears to depend both on absolute frequency and relative frequency of stimulation within each modality.},

@article{Saitis2012,
	Abstract = {The overall goal of the research presented here is to better understand how players evaluate violins within the wider context of finding relationships between measurable vibrational properties of instruments and their perceived qualities. In this study, the reliability of skilled musicians to evaluate the qualities of a violin was examined. In a first experiment, violinists were allowed to freely play a set of different violins and were then asked to rank the instruments by preference. Results showed that players were self-consistent, but a large amount of inter-individual variability was present. A second experiment was then conducted to investigate the origin of inter-individual differences in the preference for violins and to measure the extent to which different attributes of the instrument influence preference. Again, results showed large inter-individual variations in the preference for violins, as well as in assessing various characteristics of the instruments. Despite the significant lack of agreement in preference and the variability in how different criteria are evaluated between individuals, violin players tend to agree on the relevance of sound "richness" and, to a lesser extent, "dynamic range" for determining preference.},

@article{Chen2011,
	Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that in tasks requiring participants to report the direction of apparent motion, task-irrelevant mono-beeps can "capture" visual motion perception when the beeps occur temporally close to the visual stimuli. However, the contributions of the relative timing of multimodal events and the event structure, modulating uni- and/or crossmodal perceptual grouping, remain unclear. To examine this question and extend the investigation to the tactile modality, the current experiments presented tactile two-tap apparent-motion streams, with an SOA of 400 ms between successive, left-/right-hand middle-finger taps, accompanied by task-irrelevant, non-spatial auditory stimuli. The streams were shown for 90 seconds, and participants' task was to continuously report the perceived (left- or rightward) direction of tactile motion. In Experiment 1, each tactile stimulus was paired with an auditory beep, though odd-numbered taps were paired with an asynchronous beep, with audiotactile SOAs ranging from -75 ms to 75 ms. Perceived direction of tactile motion varied systematically with audiotactile SOA, indicative of a temporal-capture effect. In Experiment 2, two audiotactile SOAs--one short (75 ms), one long (325 ms)--were compared. The long-SOA condition preserved the crossmodal event structure (so the temporal-capture dynamics should have been similar to that in Experiment 1), but both beeps now occurred temporally close to the taps on one side (even-numbered taps). The two SOAs were found to produce opposite modulations of apparent motion, indicative of an influence of crossmodal grouping. In Experiment 3, only odd-numbered, but not even-numbered, taps were paired with auditory beeps. This abolished the temporal-capture effect and, instead, a dominant percept of apparent motion from the audiotactile side to the tactile-only side was observed independently of the SOA variation. These findings suggest that asymmetric crossmodal grouping leads to an attentional modulation of apparent motion, which inhibits crossmodal temporal-capture effects.},

	Abstract = {Temporal frequency is a fundamental sensory dimension in audition and touch. In audition, analysis of temporal frequency is necessary for speech and music perception; in touch, the spectral analysis of vibratory signals has been implicated in texture perception and in sensing the environment through tools. Environmental oscillations impinging upon the ear are generally thought to be processed independently of oscillations impinging upon the skin. Here, we show that frequency channels are perceptually linked across audition and touch. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we demonstrate that auditory stimuli interfere with tactile frequency perception in a systematic manner. Specifically, performance on a tactile-frequency-discrimination task is impaired when an auditory distractor is presented with the tactile stimuli, but only if the frequencies of the auditory and tactile stimuli are similar. The frequency-dependent interference effect is observed whether the distractors are pure tones or band-pass noise, so an auditory percept of pitch is not required for the effect to be produced. Importantly, distractors that strongly impair frequency discrimination do not interfere with judgments of tactile intensity. This surprisingly specific crosstalk between different modalities reflects the importance of supramodal representations of fundamental sensory dimensions.},

	Abstract = {Practicing a musical instrument is a rich multisensory experience involving the integration of visual, auditory, and tactile inputs with motor responses. This combined psychophysics-fMRI study used the musician's brain to investigate how sensory-motor experience molds temporal binding of auditory and visual signals. Behaviorally, musicians exhibited a narrower temporal integration window than nonmusicians for music but not for speech. At the neural level, musicians showed increased audiovisual asynchrony responses and effective connectivity selectively for music in a superior temporal sulcus-premotor-cerebellar circuitry. Critically, the premotor asynchrony effects predicted musicians' perceptual sensitivity to audiovisual asynchrony. Our results suggest that piano practicing fine tunes an internal forward model mapping from action plans of piano playing onto visible finger movements and sounds. This internal forward model furnishes more precise estimates of the relative audiovisual timings and hence, stronger prediction error signals specifically for asynchronous music in a premotor-cerebellar circuitry. Our findings show intimate links between action production and audiovisual temporal binding in perception.},

@article{Lahav2007,
	Abstract = {The discovery of audiovisual mirror neurons in monkeys gave rise to the hypothesis that premotor areas are inherently involved not only when observing actions but also when listening to action-related sound. However, the whole-brain functional formation underlying such "action-listening" is not fully understood. In addition, previous studies in humans have focused mostly on relatively simple and overexperienced everyday actions, such as hand clapping or door knocking. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to ask whether the human action-recognition system responds to sounds found in a more complex sequence of newly acquired actions. To address this, we chose a piece of music as a model set of acoustically presentable actions and trained non-musicians to play it by ear. We then monitored brain activity in subjects while they listened to the newly acquired piece. Although subjects listened to the music without performing any movements, activation was found bilaterally in the frontoparietal motor-related network (including Broca's area, the premotor region, the intraparietal sulcus, and the inferior parietal region), consistent with neural circuits that have been associated with action observations, and may constitute the human mirror neuron system. Presentation of the practiced notes in a different order activated the network to a much lesser degree, whereas listening to an equally familiar but motorically unknown music did not activate this network. These findings support the hypothesis of a "hearing-doing" system that is highly dependent on the individual's motor repertoire, gets established rapidly, and consists of Broca's area as its hub.},

@article{Kleber2010,
	Abstract = {Several studies have shown that motor-skill training over extended time periods results in reorganization of neural networks and changes in brain morphology. Yet, little is known about training-induced adaptive changes in the vocal system, which is largely subserved by intrinsic reflex mechanisms. We investigated highly accomplished opera singers, conservatory level vocal students, and laymen during overt singing of an Italian aria in a neuroimaging experiment. We provide the first evidence that the training of vocal skills is accompanied by increased functional activation of bilateral primary somatosensory cortex representing articulators and larynx. Opera singers showed additional activation in right primary sensorimotor cortex. Further training-related activation comprised the inferior parietal lobe and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. At the subcortical level, expert singers showed increased activation in the basal ganglia, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. A regression analysis of functional activation with accumulated singing practice confirmed that vocal skills training correlates with increased activity of a cortical network for enhanced kinesthetic motor control and sensorimotor guidance together with increased involvement of implicit motor memory areas at the subcortical and cerebellar level. Our findings may have ramifications for both voice rehabilitation and deliberate practice of other implicit motor skills that require interoception.},

	Abstract = {Learning to play a musical instrument requires complex multimodal skills involving simultaneous perception of several sensory modalities: auditory, visual, somatosensory, as well as the motor system. Therefore, musical training provides a good and adequate neuroscientific model to study multimodal brain plasticity effects in humans. Here, we investigated the impact of short-term unimodal and multimodal musical training on brain plasticity. Two groups of nonmusicians were musically trained over the course of 2 weeks. One group [sensorimotor-auditory (SA)] learned to play a musical sequence on the piano, whereas the other group [auditory (A)] listened to and made judgments about the music that had been played by participants of the sensorimotor-auditory group. Training-induced cortical plasticity was assessed by recording the musically elicited mismatch negativity (MMNm) from magnetoencephalographic measurements before and after training. SA and A groups showed significantly different cortical responses after training. Specifically, the SA group showed significant enlargement of MMNm after training compared with the A group, reflecting greater enhancement of musical representations in auditory cortex after sensorimotor-auditory training compared with after mere auditory training. Thus, we have experimentally demonstrated that not only are sensorimotor and auditory systems connected, but also that sensorimotor-auditory training causes plastic reorganizational changes in the auditory cortex over and above changes introduced by auditory training alone.},

	Abstract = {Certain sounds, such as fingernails screeching down a chalkboard, have a strong association with somatosensory percepts. In order to assess the influences of audition on somatosensory perception, three experiments measured how task-irrelevant auditory stimuli alter detection rates for near-threshold somatosensory stimuli. In Experiment 1, we showed that a simultaneous auditory stimulus increases sensitivity, but not response biases, to the detection of an electrical cutaneous stimulus delivered to the hand. Experiment 2 demonstrated that this enhancement of somatosensory perception is spatially specific--only monaural sounds on the same side increased detection. Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of audition on touch are also frequency dependent--only sounds with the same frequency as the vibrotactile frequency enhanced tactile detection. These results indicate that auditory information influences touch perception in highly systematic ways and suggest that similar coding mechanisms may underlie the processing of information from these different sensory modalities.},

@article{Levanen2001,
	Abstract = {The human nervous system displays remarkable functional plasticity following long-term sensory deprivation. For example, the auditory cortex of congenitally deaf humans may start to process tactile information. To further explore this type of cross-modal plasticity, we examined the tactile accuracy of congenitally deaf and normal hearing subjects in frequency discrimination and in detection of random suprathreshold frequency changes within a monotonous sequence of vibratory stimuli. We found that congenital deafness can enhance the accuracy of suprathreshold tactile change detection while tactile frequency discrimination is not significantly changed, although there is a trend toward reduced thresholds. The enhanced tactile sensitivity in the deaf probably reflects both neural plasticity and increased attention directed to the stimuli. Whatever the underlying neural mechanisms might be, functional compensation following early sensory loss apparently leads the remaining sensory modalities to develop capacities exceeding those of the normal functional systems.},

@article{BrescianiAl:AudioTactile,
	Abstract = {We tested whether auditory sequences of beeps can modulate the tactile perception of sequences of taps (two to four taps per sequence) delivered to the index fingertip. In the first experiment, the auditory and tactile sequences were presented simultaneously. The number of beeps delivered in the auditory sequence were either the same as, less than, or more than the number of taps of the simultaneously presented tactile sequence. Though task-irrelevant (subjects were instructed to focus on the tactile stimuli), the auditory stimuli systematically modulated subjects' tactile perception; in other words subjects' responses depended significantly on the number of delivered beeps. Such modulation only occurred when the auditory and tactile stimuli were similar enough. In the second experiment, we tested whether the automatic auditory-tactile integration depends on simultaneity or whether a bias can be evoked when the auditory and tactile sequence are presented in temporal asynchrony. Audition significantly modulated tactile perception when the stimuli were presented simultaneously but this effect gradually disappeared when a temporal asynchrony was introduced between auditory and tactile stimuli. These results show that when provided with auditory and tactile sensory signals that are likely to be generated by the same stimulus, the central nervous system (CNS) tends to automatically integrate these signals.},

We investigated whether temporal recalibration would also occur between auditory and tactile stimuli. Participants were exposed to streams of brief auditory and tactile stimuli presented in synchrony, or else with the auditory stimulus leading by 75ms. After the exposure phase, the participants made temporal order judgments regarding pairs of auditory and tactile events occurring at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. The results showed that the minimal interval necessary to correctly resolve audiotactile temporal order was larger after exposure to the desynchronized streams than after exposure to the synchronous streams. This suggests the existence of a mechanism to compensate for audiotactile asynchronies that results in a widening of the temporal window for multisensory integration.},

Throughout the experiment, half of the participants also monitored a continuous stream of words presented audiovisually, superimposed over the VCV video clips. The continuous (adapting) speech stream could either be presented in synchrony, or else with the auditory stream lagging by 300 ms. A significant shift (13 ms in the direction of the adapting stimulus in the point of subjective simultaneity) was observed in the TOJ task when participants monitored the asynchronous speech stream. This result suggests that the consequences of adapting to asynchronous speech extends beyond the case of simple audiovisual stimuli (as has recently been demonstrated by Navarra et al. in Cogn Brain Res 25:499-507, 2005) and can even affect the perception of more complex speech stimuli.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates users' ability to perform force- sensitive tapping and explores its potential as an input modal- ity in touch-based systems. We study force-sensitive tapping using Expressive Touch, a tabletop interface that infers tap- ping force from the sound waves created by the users' finger upon impact. The first part of the paper describes the im- plementation details of Expressive Touch and shows how ex- isting tabletop interfaces can be augmented to reliably detect tapping force across the entire surface. The second part of the paper reports on the results of three studies of force-sensitive tapping. First, we use a classic psychophysic task to gain insights into participants' perception of tapping force (Study 1). Results show that although participants tap with differ- ent absolute tapping forces, they have a similar perception of relative tapping force. Second, we investigate participants' ability to control tapping force (Study 2) and find that users can produce two force levels with 99\% accuracy. For six lev- els of force, accuracy drops to 58\%. Third, we investigate the usability of force tapping by studying participants' reactions to seven force-sensitive touch applications (Study 3).},

	Abstract = {Modulation of lower limb somatosensory information by tendon or plantar vibration produces directionally specific, vibration-induced falling reactions that depend on the tendon or the region of the sole that is vibrated. This study characterized the effects of different patterns of plantar cutaneo-muscular vibration and bilateral Achilles tendon vibration (ATV) on the postural strategies observed during quiet and perturbed stance. Twelve healthy young participants stood barefooted, with their vision blocked, on two sets of plantar vibrators placed on two AMTI force plates embedded in a moveable support surface. Two other vibrators were positioned over the Achilles tendons. Participants were randomly exposed to different patterns of plantar cutaneo-muscular and ATV. Tilts of the support surface in the toes-up (TU) and toes-down (TD) directions were given 5-8s after the beginning of vibration. Body kinematics in 3D and ground reaction forces were recorded. Bilateral ATV applied with or without rearfoot vibration (RFV) during quiet stance resulted in a whole-body backward leaning accompanied by an increase in trunk extension and hip and knee flexion. RFV alone produced a forward whole-body tilt with increased flexion in trunk, hip, and ankle. When stance was perturbed by TU tilts, the center of mass (CoM) and center of pressure (CoP) displacements were larger in the presence of RFV or ATV and associated with increased peak trunk flexion. TD tilts with or without ATV resulted in no significant difference in CoM and CoP displacements, while larger trunk extension and smaller distal angular displacements were observed during ATV. RFV altered the magnitude of the balance reactions, as observed by an increase in CoP displacements and variable response in trunk displacement. Significant interactions between ATV and RFV were obtained for the peak angular excursions for both directions of perturbations, where ATV either enhanced (for TU tilts) or attenuated (for TD tilts) the influence of RFV. Manipulating somatosensory information from the plantar cutaneo-muscular and muscle spindle Ia afferents thus results in altered and widespread postural responses, as shown by profound changes in body kinematics and CoM and CoP displacements. This suggests that the CNS uses plantar cutaneo-muscular and ankle spindle afferent inputs to build an appropriate reference of verticality that influences the control of equilibrium during quiet and perturbed stance.},

@article{Kocsis2013a,
	Abstract = {Two-interval two-alternative forced-choice discrimination experiments were conducted separately for sinusoidal and triangular textured surface gratings from which amplitude (i.e., height) discrimination thresholds were estimated. Participants (group sizes: n = 4 to 7) explored one of these texture types either by fingertip on real gratings (Finger real), by stylus on real gratings (Stylus real), or by stylus on virtual gratings (Stylus virtual). The real gratings were fabricated from stainless steel by an electrical discharge machining process while the virtual gratings were rendered via a programmable force-feedback device. All gratings had a 2.5-mm spatial period. On each trial, participants compared test gratings with 55, 60, 65, or 70 $\mu$m amplitudes against a 50-$\mu$m reference. The results indicate that discrimination thresholds did not differ significantly between sinusoidal and triangular gratings. With sinusoidal and triangular data combined, the average (mean + standard error) for the Stylus-real threshold (2.5 $\pm$ 0.2 $\mu$m) was significantly smaller (p <; 0.01) than that for the Stylus-virtual condition (4.9 $\pm$ 0.2 $\mu$m). Differences between the Finger-real threshold (3.8 $\pm$ 0.2 $\mu$m) and those from the other two conditions were not statistically significant. Further studies are needed to better understand the differences in perceptual cues resulting from interactions with real and virtual gratings.},

@article{Sinclair2014,
	Abstract = {With real-time models of friction that take velocity as input, accuracy depends in great part on adequately estimating velocity from position measurements. This process can be sensitive to noise, especially at high sampling rates. In audio-haptic acoustic simulations, often characterized by friction-induced, relaxation-type stick-slip oscillations, this gives a gritty, dry haptic feel and a raspy, unnatural sound. Numerous techniques have been proposed, but each depend on tuning parameters so that they may offer a good trade-off between delay and noise rejection. In an effort to compare fairly, each of thirteen methods considered in the present study was automatically optimized and evaluated; finally a subset of these were compared subjectively. Results suggest that no one method is ideal for all gain levels, though the best general performance was found by using a sliding-mode differentiator as input to a Kalman integrator. An additional conclusion is that estimators do not approach the quality available in physical velocity transduction, and therefore such sensors should be considered in haptic device design.},

@article{Salisbury2011,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we extend the concept of the contrast sensitivity function - used to evaluate video projectors - to the evaluation of haptic devices. We propose using human observers to determine if vibrations rendered using a given haptic device are accompanied by artifacts detectable to humans. This determination produces a performance measure that carries particular relevance to applications involving texture rendering. For cases in which a device produces detectable artifacts, we have developed a protocol that localizes deficiencies in device design and/or hardware implementation. In this paper, we present results from human vibration detection experiments carried out using three commercial haptic devices and one high performance voice coil motor. We found that all three commercial devices produced perceptible artifacts when rendering vibrations near human detection thresholds. Our protocol allowed us to pinpoint the deficiencies, however, and we were able to show that minor modifications to the haptic hardware were sufficient to make these devices well suited for rendering vibrations, and by extension, the vibratory components of textures. We generalize our findings to provide quantitative design guidelines that ensure the ability of haptic devices to proficiently render the vibratory components of textures.},

However, during the course of our research to develop a full-hand vibrotactile musical communication device for the hearing-impaired, we repeatedly found evidence suggesting sensitivity to higher frequencies. Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators. The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices for music and other applications.},

Discrimination between cello, piano, and trombone tones matched for F0, duration, and magnitude was above chance with white noise masking the sound output of the voice coils (Experiment 1), with additional masking to control for bone-conducted sound (Experiment 2), and among a group of deaf individuals (Experiment 4a). Hearing (Experiment 3) and deaf individuals (Experiment 4b) also successfully discriminated between dull and bright timbres varying only with regard to spectral centroid.

Piezoelectric actuators are emerging as one suitable technology for rendering expressive haptic feedback on mobile devices. We describe the design of redundant piezoelectric haptic augmentations of touchscreen GUI buttons, progress bars, and scroll bars, and their evaluation under varying cognitive load. Our haptically augmented progress bars and scroll bars led to significantly faster task completion, and favourable subjective reactions. We further discuss resulting insights into designing useful haptic feedback for touchscreens and highlight challenges, including means of enhancing usability, types of interactions where value is maximized, difficulty in disambiguating background from foreground signals, tradeoffs in haptic strength vs. resolution, and subtleties in evaluating these types of interactions.},

	Abstract = {Computational haptics is the art and science of creating systems that interact with the sense of touch. To simulate surface textures we constructed a haptic interaction system called Sandpaper, which uses a force-feedback joystick and a novel lateral-force gradient algorithm. Using this system, we created haptic simulations of mechanical systems, solid materials, real- world surface textures, non-physical materials, and some haptic representations of medical imag- ery, and a user interface prototype. We conducted a program of exploratory research on haptic perception of simulated textures. The first experiment studied whether subjects were convinced that the lateral-force gradient simula- tions felt like textured surfaces. Confidence was high for certain kinds of simulations of texture and surface features, but low for simulations of other kinds of smooth, jittery, and other non-tex- tural materials. The subjects' descriptions provided rich information about the role of force magni- tudes, feature sizes, and several other aspects of the simulations. Two more experiments were aimed at understanding the perceptual aspect of texture called roughness. We concluded that in the case of grating textures - that is, small, periodic ridges - the roughness percept can be almost entirely predicted by the maximum lateral force encountered when feeling the simulation. This could provide controlled roughness feelings in haptic simulation environments. We propose a framework for haptic models based on using both physically-based and perceptu- ally-based representations of the haptic properties of objects and situations. We also consider rep- resentative-based descriptions that refer to familiar types of objects. Perceptually-based representations may be especially useful for interaction technologies, and describing perceptual phenomena in terms of physically-based models should lead to effective and efficient ways to implement haptic simulations. The qualitative results of these studies underscore the multidimen- sional nature of haptic texture and materials perception. Improvements and extensions to the present work are discussed as well as a program of research in haptic interaction. An extensive bibliography in haptics and related fields is included.},

The digital revolution has brought about a new relationship between the instruâ ment and the corporeal performing musician, and despite the obvious benefits of the process of digitization such as the democratization of musical skills, it may have also left us handicapped in some ways. The acoustic piano, which has held a central position in Western classical music, is used as a starting point for the disâ cussion. The concept of sedimentation in the context of musical instruments is discussed, and three potential drawbacks of digitization are outlined: 1) digital perfection and the loss of ``transcendence through flaws''; 2) separation of the inâ terface and the sound, and performer's loss of ``finding the instrument''; and 3) loss of the opportunity of creating the new by destroying the old.},

	Abstract = {Stochastic resonance (SR) occurs when the detection of a subthreshold signal is aided by the presence of random energy fluctuations in the signal modality, commonly called noise. SR is counterintuitive because such noise usually worsens performance. Nonetheless, SR has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally in human sensory systems. Using a psychophysically sophisticated paradigm, we show that SR aids the detection of vibrating touch stimuli presented to the foot soles of both healthy elderly people with elevated vibrotactile thresholds and healthy young people with normal vibrotactile thresholds. The results also suggest that it is possible to know a priori the amount of noise needed for optimal SR effects given the degree to which the signal is subthreshold. Thus, SR may be practical as a rehabilitative aid for individuals with elevated sensory thresholds.},

	Abstract = {Finger-pressing forces are produced by activation of the intrinsic hand muscles, which are finger specific, and the extrinsic muscles that connect to multiple fingers. We tested a hypothesis of greater weakening of intrinsic hand muscles with age and quantified associated indexes of finger interaction such as enslaving (force production by unintended fingers) and force deficit (loss of finger force in multifinger tasks compared with single-finger tasks). Twelve young (23-35 yr old) and 12 elderly (70-95 yr old) men and women performed single-finger and four-finger maximal pressing tasks, in which force was applied at the proximal phalanges (PP, the intrinsic muscles are major focal force generators) and at the distal phalanges (DP, the extrinsic muscles are focal force generators). The decline in the peak force with age was greater at PP (30\%) than at DP (19\%). Larger indexes of finger interaction were observed at PP (enslaving = 17.2 +/- 9.4\%, force deficit = 36.1 +/- 11.1\%) than at DP (enslaving = 14.9 +/- 8.8\%, force deficit = 27.7 +/- 10.8\%) across ages and genders. We conclude that intrinsic hand muscles show disproportionate weakening with age. The greater indexes of finger interaction in PP tests with greater involvement of intrinsic hand muscles suggest that the finger interactions are predominantly of a central origin across ages and genders.},

@article{Keenan2012,
	Abstract = {Mobile computing devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) that have low-friction surfaces require well-directed fingertip forces of sufficient and precise magnitudes for proper use. Although general impairments in manual dexterity are well-documented in older adults, it is unclear how these sensorimotor impairments influence the ability of older adults to dexterously manipulate fixed, low-friction surfaces in particular. 21 young and 18 older (65+ yrs) adults produced maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) and steady submaximal forces (2.5 and 10\% MVC) with the fingertip of the index finger. A Teflon covered custom-molded splint was placed on the fingertip. A three-axis force sensor was covered with either Teflon or sandpaper to create low- and high-friction surfaces, respectively. Maximal downward forces (F(z)) were similar (p = .135) for young and older adults, and decreased by 15\% (p<.001) while pressing on Teflon compared to sandpaper. Fluctuations in F(z) during the submaximal force-matching tasks were 2.45Ã greater (p<.001) for older adults than in young adults, and reached a maximum when older adults pressed against the Teflon surface while receiving visual feedback. These age-associated changes in motor performance are explained, in part, by altered muscle activity from three hand muscles and out-of-plane forces. Quantifying the ability to produce steady fingertip forces against low-friction surfaces may be a better indicator of impairment and disability than the current practice of evaluating maximal forces with pinch meters. These age-associated impairments in dexterity while interacting with low-friction surfaces may limit the use of the current generation of computing interfaces by older adults.},

@incollection{VanDoorn:2012,
	Abstract = {Active touch is often described as yielding ``better-quality'' information than passive touch. However, some authors have argued that passive-guided movements generate superior percepts due to a reduction in demands on the haptic sensory system. We consider the possibility that passive-guided conditions, as used in most active-passive comparisons, are relatively free from cognitive decision-making, while active conditions involve cognitive loads that are quite high and uncharacteristic of normal sensory processes. Thus studies that purport to show differences in active and passive touch may instead be revealing differences in the amount of cognition involved in active and passive tasks. We hypothesized that passive-guided conditions reduce not the sensory load but the cognitive load that active explorers must bear. To test this hypothesis Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) activity was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during active and passive-guided fingertip exploration of 2D raised line drawings. Active movements resulted in greater activation (compared with passive movements) in areas implicated in higher order processes such as monitoring and controlling of goal-directed behavior, attention, execution of movements, and error detection. Passive movements, in contrast, produced greater BOLD activity in areas associated with touch perception, length discrimination, tactile object recognition, and efference copy. The activation of a greater number of higher-order processing areas during active relative to passive-guided exploration suggests that instances of passive-guided superiority may not be due to the haptic system's limited ability to cope with sensory inputs, but rather the restriction imposed by the use of a single finger such that active exploration may require cognitive strategies not demanded in the passive condition. Our findings suggest that previous attempts to compare active and passive touch have, in order to simplify tasks, inadvertently introduced cognitive load at the expense of normal sensory inputs.},

To address this problem, we present a model for bowed string interaction based on a position-constraint friction. We validate the proposed model by comparing to previous work using off-line simulations, and show measurements of interaction on haptic hardware. This noise-free excitation signal leads to cleaner string motion than previous models, thereby improving the quality of force and audio synthesis in the presence of noise.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents integrated vibrotactiles, a novel interface for movement and posture tuition that provides real-time feedback in a tactile form by means of interactive haptic feedback. Thereby conveying information neither acoustically nor visually and it is a promising feedback means for movements in 3D-space. In this paper we demonstrate haptic augmentation for applications for musicians, since it (a) doesn't affect the visual sense, occupied by reading music and communication, (b) doesn't disturb in bang sensitive situations such as concerts, (c) allows to relate feedback information in the same tactile medium as the output of the musical instrument, so that an important feedback channel for musical instrument playing is extended and trained supportive. Even more, instructions from the teacher and the computer can be transmitted directly and unobtrusively in this channel. This paper presents a prototype system together with demonstrations of applications that support violinists during musical instrument learning.},

	Abstract = {The tactile detectability of sinusoidal and square-wave virtual texture gratings were measured and analyzed. Using a three-interval one-up three-down adaptive tracking procedure, detection thresholds for virtual gratings were estimated using a custom-designed high position-resolution 3-degrees-of-freedom force-feedback haptic device. Two types of gratings were used, defined by sinusoidal and square waveforms, with spatial wavelengths of 0.2 to 25.6 mm. The results indicated that the participants demonstrated a higher sensitivity (i.e., lower detection threshold) to square-wave gratings than to sinusoidal ones at all the wavelengths tested. When the square-wave gratings were represented by the explicative Fourier series, it became apparent that the detectability of the square-wave gratings could be determined by that of the sinusoidal gratings at the corresponding fundamental frequencies. This was true for any square-wave grating as long as the detection threshold for the fundamental component was below those of the harmonic components},

	Abstract = {We present TUIC, a technology that enables tangible interaction on capacitive multi-touch devices, such as iPad, iPhone, and 3M's multi-touch displays, without requiring any hardware modifications. TUIC simulates finger touches on capacitive displays using passive materials and active modulation circuits embedded inside tangible objects, and can be used with multi-touch gestures simultaneously. TUIC consists of three approaches to sense and track objects: spatial, frequency, and hybrid (spatial plus frequency). The spatial approach, also known as 2D markers, uses geometric, multi-point touch patterns to encode object IDs. Spatial tags are straightforward to construct and are easily tracked when moved, but require sufficient spacing between the multiple touch points. The frequency approach uses modulation circuits to generate high-frequency touches to encode object IDs in the time domain. It requires fewer touch points and allows smaller tags to be built. The hybrid approach combines both spatial and frequency tags to construct small tags that can be reliably tracked when moved and rotated. We show three applications demonstrating the above approaches on iPads and 3M's multi-touch displays.},

	Abstract = {The principle of common coding suggests that a joint representation is formed when actions are repeatedly paired with a specific perceptual event. Musicians are occupationally specialized with regard to the coupling between actions and their auditory effects. In the present study, we employed a novel paradigm to demonstrate automatic action-effect associations in pianists. Pianists and nonmusicians pressed keys according to aurally presented number sequences. Numbers were presented at pitches that were neutral, congruent, or incongruent with respect to pitches that would normally be produced by such actions. Response time differences were seen between congruent and incongruent sequences in pianists alone. A second experiment was conducted to determine whether these effects could be attributed to the existence of previously documented spatial/pitch compatibility effects. In a "stretched" version of the task, the pitch distance over which the numbers were presented was enlarged to a range that could not be produced by the hand span used in Experiment 1. The finding of a larger response time difference between congruent and incongruent trials in the original, standard, version compared with the stretched version, in pianists, but not in nonmusicians, indicates that the effects obtained are, at least partially, attributable to learned action effects.},

	Abstract = {There is a small but growing literature on the perception of natural acoustic events, but few attempts have been made to investigate complex sounds not systematically controlled within a laboratory setting. The present study investigates listeners' ability to make judgments about the posture (upright-stooped) of the walker who generated acoustic stimuli contrasted on each trial. We use a comprehensive three-stage approach to event perception, in which we develop a solid understanding of the source event and its sound properties, as well as the relationships between these two event stages. Developing this understanding helps both to identify the limitations of common statistical procedures and to develop effective new procedures for investigating not only the two information stages above, but also the decision strategies employed by listeners in making source judgments from sound. The result is a comprehensive, ultimately logical, but not necessarily expected picture of both the source-sound-perception loop and the utility of alternative research tools.},

@article{Maclean2008,
	Abstract = {This article is the second of a two-part series intended to be an introduction to haptic interfaces, their construction, and application design. Haptic interactions employ mechanical, programmed physical devices that can be used for human-computer communication via the sense of touch. In Part I of this series, we focused on the devices themselves: the classes of hardware schemes currently available or envisioned, the software components that drive them, and specific examples that can be built on the kitchen table. Here in Part II, we broach a topic that is coming into its own; between the vision of a particular utility that haptic feedback theoretically should enable and the hardware capable of delivering the required sensations is the problem of designing the interaction in a usable way.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes work on a system that incorporates haptic feedback into digital sound editing software. Currently, the most common methods for navigating through digital audio are with comptuer keyboards and mice. Occasionally, peripheral consoles may be used that provide passive knobs. In each of these cases, the user relies on visual and aural feedback, without any haptic feedback related to the audio waveform. This work investigates the premise that the addition of relevant haptic feedback will substantially improve the user experience, including greater efficiency and gratification.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents a multi-modal approach to tightly close the in- teraction loop between a human user and any tool in operation. Every activity of a human being generates multi-modal feedback, more or less related to the eyes (visual), the skin (sensory), the nose (olfactory) and the ears (auditive). Here we show the useful augmentation or complete creation of a nonexistent or less avail- able feedback. As an example the performance of drilling tasks, line drawing tasks, or the complex task of bowing a violin can be considered. Some new multimodal human computer interaction technologies based on sensors and embedded systems are shown and described in this paper.},

@inproceedings{Giordano2010,
	Abstract = {We investigated how auditory and haptic information about the hardness of objects is integrated for the purpose of controlling the velocity with which we strike an object. Our experimental manipulations and data analyses considered a variety of factors that should be integrated in a theory of multisensory per- ception: expertise of the perceiver; context (unimodal vs. multimodal); between-modalities congruence; between-participants agreement in sensory weighting; performance. On a trial, participants struck a virtual object with a target constant velocity and received feedback on correctness. When the performance criterion was reached, feedback was eliminated, the auditory and/or haptic hardness of the struck object were changed, and the effects on subsequent striking velocity and performance were measured. In unimodal trials only the haptic or auditory display was presented. In multisensory trials, the audio-haptic changes could be congruent (e.g., both increased in hardness) or incongruent. We recruited participants with different levels of expertise with the task: percussionists, nonpercussionist musicians and nonmusicians. For both modalities, striking velocity increased with decreasing hardness, and vice versa. With the vast majority of participants, changes in haptic hardness were perceptually more relevant because they influ- enced striking velocity to a greater degree than changes in auditory hardness. The perceptual weighting of auditory information was robust to context variations (unimodal vs. multimodal), independent of exper- tise, uniform across participants and modulated by audio-haptic congruence. The perceptual weighting of haptic information was modulated by context and expertise, more varied across participants and robust to changes in audio-haptic congruence. Performance in tracking velocity was more strongly affected by haptic than auditory information, was not at its best in a multisensory context and was independent of information congruence.},

@article{Lindsell2003,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare vibrotactile thresholds between five international test centres, to determine causes of variability, and to provide normative data for use by health professionals. METHODS: Vibrotactile thresholds were measured on various fingers in 1,008 subjects at 31.5 Hz (2,531 measurements) and at 125 Hz (2,807 measurements). Three centres used the up-and-down method of limits, rate of change of stimulus 3dB/s, to obtain vibrotactile thresholds. The push force on the surround was 2 N, the probe contact force was 1 N and the probe diameter was 6 mm concentric to a 10-mm diameter hole in the surround. One centre used an up-and-down method of limits with a 5-dB step and a 1.26-mm diameter probe with no surround. Another centre used a stepping algorithm, no surround, and the force on the 6-mm-diameter probe was unspecified. RESULTS: The 31.5-Hz thresholds and 125-Hz thresholds, expressed in dB, were similar between centres using similar methods. There were small (<5 dB) differences in vibrotactile thresholds between male and female subjects, between white-collar and blue-collar workers and between fingers. Both 31.5-Hz and 125-Hz thresholds increased with age; the mean effect of age on 31.5-Hz thresholds was approximately 2 dB over 25 years, while the effect of age on 125 Hz-thresholds was as high as 10 dB over 25 years. CONCLUSIONS: Vibrotactile thresholds are influenced by measurement method but can be similar at different centres if similar methods are used. Effects of measurement location and gender are often negligible. Thresholds depend on age, but over the range of ages considered, only the effect on 125-Hz thresholds is sufficient for correction; methods of correcting for age are given. These normative data may be used to assist the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy involving vibrotactile sensation.},

	Abstract = {Foot pedals can be problematic in performances of live electronic music since they do not provide direct feedback to the performer as to their state. Performers expect such feedback since their action affects the composition through triggering different computer functions. It is essential for performers to know how their actions affect sound, just as they do with acoustic instruments. In computer music, electronic devices are not able to replicate this feedback, creating a gap in sensory experience. This gap has the tendency to create insecurity with performers about their actions regarding the computer functionality. This paper details a proposed technical solution that could help performers and composers overcome these issues.},

@article{QueraltAl:auditoryStartleWalking,
	Abstract = {Movement execution is speeded up when a startle auditory stimulus is applied with an imperative signal in a simple reaction time task experiment, a phenomenon described as StartReact. The effect has been recently observed in a step adjustment task requiring fast selection of specific movements in a choice reaction time task. Therefore, we hypothesized that inducing a StartReact effect may be beneficial in obstacle avoidance under time pressure, when subjects have to perform fast gait adjustments. Twelve healthy young adults walked on a treadmill and obstacles were released in specific moments of the step cycle. On average the EMG onset latency in the biceps femoris shortened by 20\% while amplitude increased by 50\%, in trials in which an auditory startle accompanied obstacle avoidance. The presentation of a startle increased the probability of using a long step strategy, enlarged stride length modifications and resulted in higher success rates, to avoid the obstacle. We also examined the effects of the startle in a condition in which the obstacle was not present in comparison to a condition in which the obstacle was visibly present but it did not fall. In the latter condition, the obstacle avoidance reaction occurred with a similar latency but smaller amplitude as in trials in which the obstacle was actually released. Our results suggest that the motor programmes used for obstacle avoidance are probably stored at subcortical structures. The release of these motor programmes by a startling auditory stimulus may combine intersensory facilitation and the StartReact effect.},

Our point of view is an in- terdisciplinary one: taking into account technical considerations about control theory and sound processing, we try to explore the expressivenessworld which is closer to psychology theories. Start- ing from a state of the art which outlines two main approaches to the problem of ''making sound with gestures'', we will delve into psychological theories about expressiveness, describing in partic- ular possible applications dealing with intermodality and mixed reality environments related to the Gestalt Theory. HCI design can indeed benefit from this kind of approach because of the quanti- tative methods that can be applied to measure expressiveness. In- terfaces can be used in order to convey expressiveness, which is a plus of information that can help interacting with the machine; this kind of information can be coded as spatio-temporal schemes, as it is stated in Gestalt theory.},

	Abstract = {Somatosensory function declines with age, and such changes have been associated with diminished motor performance. Input noise can enhance sensory and motor function. We asked young and elderly participants to stand quietly on vibrating gel-based insoles, and calculated sway parameters and random-walk variables. In our 27 participants, application of noise resulted in a reduction in seven of eight sway parameters in young participants and all of the sway variables in elderly participants. Elderly participants showed greater improvement than young people in two variables, mediolateral range (p=0.008), and critical mean square displacement (p=0.012). Noise-based devices, such as randomly vibrating insoles, could ameliorate age-related impairments in balance control.},

@article{VerschuerenAl:tendonVibrationLocomotion,
	Abstract = {The present study was set up to examine the contribution of Ia afferent input in the generation of electromyographic (EMG) activity. Subjects walked blindfolded along a walkway while tendon vibration was applied continuously to a leg muscle. The effects of vibration were measured on mean EMG activity in stance and swing phase. The results show that vibration of the quadriceps femoris (Q) at the knee and of biceps femoris (BF) at the knee enhanced the EMG activity of these muscles and this occurred mainly in the stance phase of walking. These results suggest involvement of Ia afferent input of Q and BF in EMG activation during stance. In contrast, vibration of muscles at the ankle and hip had no significant effect on burst amplitude. Additionally, the onset time of tibialis anterior was measured to look at timing of phase transitions. Only vibration of quadriceps femoris resulted in an earlier onset of tibialis anterior within the gait cycle, suggesting involvement of these Ia afferents in the triggering of phase transitions. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest involvement of Ia afferent input in the control of muscle activity during locomotion in humans. A limited role in timing of phase transitions is proposed as well.},

@article{Piercy1986a,
	Abstract = {The threshold of vibrotactile perception at the finger tip has been measured for six forest workers who regularly use a chain saw, and, for comparison, ten laboratory workers with no significant vibration exposure. All subjects were carefully screened for confounding medical variables, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and diabetes. The measurements were performed over the frequency range of 4--400 Hz in the laboratory to permit careful control of physical variables, such as orientation of the vibrating probe with respect to the finger tip, contact force, and hand movement. Preliminary analysis of our results, together with those of others, suggests that the neurological component of the handâarm vibration syndrome develops first as a change in the threshold of Pacinian corpuscles, which later spreads to the other cutaneous mechanoreceptors.},
