abstract = {In this paper we present tactile feedback and stimulation design principles for applications in music technology and media. We discuss features and limitations of the human sense of touch, in the context of conveying musical content solely via the tactile sense. These factors should be firmly taken into account when designing a tactile-augmented interface. Applications of tactile displays in the field of music and media are then presented using a three-fold taxonomy of tactile feedback. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {An experiment has been conducted, measuring pianists' sensitivity to piano key vibrations at the fingers while playing an upright or a grand Yamaha Disklavier piano. At each trial, which consisted in playing loud and long A notes across the whole keyboard, vibrations were either present or absent through setting the Disklavier pianos to normal or quiet mode. Sound feedback was always pro- vided by a MIDI controlled piano synthesizer via isolating ear/headphones, which masked the acoustic sound in nor- mal mode. In partial disagreement with the existing liter- ature, our results suggest that significant vibrotactile cues are produced in the lower range of the piano keyboard, with perceptual cut-off around the middle octave. Possible psy- chophysical mechanisms supporting the existence of such cues are additionally discussed.},
