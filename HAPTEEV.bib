abstract = {Ultrasonic friction modulation can elicit texture sensations on a smooth surface but is currently limited to single touch exploration. This paper introduces a technique that locally modulates tactile friction on a surface to allow for a multitouch exploration. Using this technique, the friction modulation effect is co-located with the actuator through the use of specific non-radiating frequencies. Because waves do not propagate in the surface at these specific frequencies, the vibration amplitude is controlled locally with a simple harmonic excitation of the actuators. The existence of such frequencies is explained through a semi-analytical model of piezoelectric actuation. The ability to locally control the vibration field and to modulate the friction independently for each actuator is demonstrated experimentally on a thin glass plate.},

abstract = {A number of researchers and companies have investigated methods to improve touchscreen interaction through actuators provid- ing vibrotactile stimuli. Wave propagation enables remote actuation but makes such stimuli perceivable all over the surface. In this paper, we report the use of an array of actuators combined with a spatio-temporal inverse filter to produce independent vibrotactile feedback at different positions on a surface. A experimental evaluation showed that this setup successfully corrects for distortion, reverberation and cross talk between piezoelectric actuators glued to a glass surface providing 300 Hz burst vibrations. A user study conducted with 10 participants demonstrated that this filtering not only improved the user's discrimination but also required less concentration when compared to a method without such filtering},
