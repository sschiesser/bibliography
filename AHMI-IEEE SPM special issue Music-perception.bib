abstract = {This paper is concerned with the perception of complex vibrotactile stimuli in which a few sinusoidal vibrations with different frequencies are superimposed. We begin with an observation that such vibrotactile signals are analogous to musical chords in which multiple notes are played simultaneously. A set of so-called "vibrotactile chords" are designed on the basis of musical chords, and their degrees of consonance (harmony) that participants perceive are evaluated through a perceptual experiment. Experimental results indicate that participants can reliably rate the degrees of consonance of vibrotactile chords and establish a well-defined function that relates the degree of consonance to the base and chordal frequency of a vibrotactile chord. These findings have direct implications for the design of complex vibrotactile signals that can be produced by current wideband actuators such as voice-coil, piezoelectric, and electroactive polymer actuators.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the temporal factors involved in the integration of auditory and tactile information. Perceptual threshold values for auditory-tactile asynchrony were measured using a broadband noise for the auditory stimulus (presented to the subjects via headphones) and a sinusoidal wave for the tactile stimulus (presented at the tip of the index finger via a shaker). In the first experiment, subjects were asked to make a three-alternative forced-choice judgment whether the audio stimulus and the tactile stimulus were synchronous, the audio stimulus preceded the tactile stimulus, or the tactile stimulus preceded the audio stimulus. Stimuli with audio delays in the range of –26 to 51 ms were judged synchronous. In the second experiment, the judgement was whether the auditory stimulus and the tactile stimulus were synchronous or asynchronous. The results showed that stimuli with audio delays in the range of –24 to 50 ms were judged synchronous. In the third experiment the subjects had to judge whether the audio stimulus preceded the tactile stimulus, or the tactile stimulus preceded the audio stimulus. Stimuli with audio delays in the range of –13 to 28 ms were judged synchronous.},

abstract = {We investigated how auditory and haptic information about the hardness of objects is integrated for the purpose of controlling the velocity with which we strike an object. Our experimental manipulations and data analyses considered a variety of factors that should be integrated in a theory of multisensory per- ception: expertise of the perceiver; context (unimodal vs. multimodal); between-modalities congruence; between-participants agreement in sensory weighting; performance. On a trial, participants struck a virtual object with a target constant velocity and received feedback on correctness. When the performance criterion was reached, feedback was eliminated, the auditory and/or haptic hardness of the struck object were changed, and the effects on subsequent striking velocity and performance were measured. In unimodal trials only the haptic or auditory display was presented. In multisensory trials, the audio-haptic changes could be congruent (e.g., both increased in hardness) or incongruent. We recruited participants with different levels of expertise with the task: percussionists, nonpercussionist musicians and nonmusicians. For both modalities, striking velocity increased with decreasing hardness, and vice versa. With the vast majority of participants, changes in haptic hardness were perceptually more relevant because they influ- enced striking velocity to a greater degree than changes in auditory hardness. The perceptual weighting of auditory information was robust to context variations (unimodal vs. multimodal), independent of exper- tise, uniform across participants and modulated by audio-haptic congruence. The perceptual weighting of haptic information was modulated by context and expertise, more varied across participants and robust to changes in audio-haptic congruence. Performance in tracking velocity was more strongly affected by haptic than auditory information, was not at its best in a multisensory context and was independent of information congruence.},

This article presents a qualitative study of a simulated instrumental interaction in the case of the virtual bowed string, using both waveguide and mass-interaction models. Subjects were invited to explore the possibilities of the simulations and to express themselves verbally at the same time, allowing us to identify key qualities of the proposed systems that determine the construction of an intimate and rich relationship with the users.},

abstract = {An experiment has been conducted, measuring pianists' sensitivity to piano key vibrations at the fingers while playing an upright or a grand Yamaha Disklavier piano. At each trial, which consisted in playing loud and long A notes across the whole keyboard, vibrations were either present or absent through setting the Disklavier pianos to normal or quiet mode. Sound feedback was always pro- vided by a MIDI controlled piano synthesizer via isolating ear/headphones, which masked the acoustic sound in nor- mal mode. In partial disagreement with the existing liter- ature, our results suggest that significant vibrotactile cues are produced in the lower range of the piano keyboard, with perceptual cut-off around the middle octave. Possible psy- chophysical mechanisms supporting the existence of such cues are additionally discussed.},

@article{Wollman2014a,
abstract = {The role of auditory and tactile modalities involved in violin playing and evaluation was investigated in an experiment employing a blind violin evaluation task under different conditions: i) normal playing conditions, ii) playing with auditory masking, and iii) playing with vibrotactile masking. Under each condition, 20 violinists evaluated five violins according to criteria related to violin playing and sound characteristics and rated their overall quality and relative preference. Results show that both auditory and vibrotactile feedback are important in the violinists' evaluations but that their relative importance depends on the violinist, the violin and the type of evaluation (different criteria ratings or preference). In this way, the overall quality ratings were found to be accurately predicted by the rating criteria, which also proved to be perceptually relevant to violinists, but were poorly correlated with the preference ratings; this suggests that the two types of ratings (overall quality vs preference) may stem from different decision-making strategies. Furthermore, the experimental design confirmed that violinists agree more on the importance of criteria in their overall evaluation than on their actual ratings for different violins. In particular, greater agreement was found on the importance of criteria related to the sound of the violin. Nevertheless, this study reveals that there are fundamental differences in the way players interpret and evaluate each criterion, which may explain why correlating physical properties with perceptual properties has been challenging so far in the field of musical acoustics.},

abstract = {In this study, an experiment was conducted to determine the influence of vibration on loudness perception. Vertical whole-body vibrations were produced using an individually calibrated electro-dynamic shaker. A pair of closed dynamic headphones was used for audio reproduction. A loudness matching experiment was carried out with 28 participants. In this experiment, sinusoidal sounds were presented in the absence and presence of simultaneous vibrations. Participants had to match the level of the acoustic stimuli while ignoring the tactile stimulation. The loudness matching experiment was carried out for four sinusoidal tones, at the frequencies of 10, 20, 63 and 200 Hz. Three different vibration levels (4, 8 and 12 dB above the vibration threshold for each participant) were used to study the influence of the vibration amplitude. Results indicate that whole-body vibration had a significant influence on loudness perception. When an acoustic stimulus was accompanied by vibration, the level of the acoustic stimulus was perceived one decibel higher on average.},

We found that integrated vibrotactile feedback resulted in an increase in performer engagement with the instrument, but resulted in a reduction in the perceived control of the instrument.

abstract = {This paper investigated how auditory and vibrotactile feedback information is integrated within the context of violin quality evaluation. Fifteen violinists evaluated three violins on four criteria-"Rich Sound," "Loud and Powerful," "Alive and Responsive," and "Pleasure"-during a perceptual experiment. Violinists first evaluated the violins one at a time under three experimental conditions: (1) playing, (2) listening to it (played by a professional player) in an active way by fingering the score on an isolated neck, (3) same as (2) with vibrotactile feedback provided at the isolated neck. Violinists were then asked to evaluate the violins through pairwise comparisons under condition (3): Each violin was paired with itself while the level of vibrations of the isolated neck was either the original one or divided by two. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that Loud and Powerful judgments were affected by the presence of vibrations given that violins were rated louder in condition (3) than in (2). In the second part, violins were rated more positively with original vibration level at the isolated neck than with half the level, for all criteria but Alive and Responsive. Consistently with sensory interaction, the magnitude of the enhancement remained relatively constant across violins.},
