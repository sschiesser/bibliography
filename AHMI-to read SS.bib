@inproceedings{MarshallWanderley:vtactileFeel,
abstract = {This paper deals with the effects of integrated vibrotactile feedback on the “feel” of a digital musical instrument (DMI). Building on previous work developing a DMI with integrated vibrotactile feedback actuators, we discuss how to produce instrument-like vibrations, compare these simulated vibrations with those produced by an acoustic instrument and examine how the integration of this feedback effects performer ratings of the instrument. We found that integrated vibrotactile feedback resulted in an increase in performer engagement with the instrument, but resulted in a reduction in the perceived control of the instrument. We discuss these results and their implications for the design of new digital musical instruments.},

@article{Bongers:TactSound,
abstract = {In order to enhance the control of electronic sound sources (synthesisers), multiple modes of interaction can be introduced. In this paper, several technologies for tactual display of properties of the sound and new methods of control will be described. For example, input devices such as gloves, gesture trackers and other technologies adapted from virtual reality research were applied to increase the number of sound parameters that the player can control simultaneously. Some initial work has been carried out with simple actuators for tactual feedback.},
