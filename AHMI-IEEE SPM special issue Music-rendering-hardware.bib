abstract = {This paper presents a study of gestural control applied to sound synthesis. It discusses an implementation of real- time gestural control of the CHANT software (Max/MSP). The input device consists of a Wacom graphic tablet instrumented with additional sensors. A study has been carried out on the selection of transducer technologies to match the available synthesis parameters, based on existing literature. In order to prove the validity of previous studies, different user tests have been devised and implemented. User reactions were annotated and further evaluated. An exploratory analysis of the tests' results is presented which tends to validate previous works.},

@inproceedings{MarshallWanderley:vtactileFB,
abstract = {This paper discusses vibrotactile feedback in digital musical instruments. It compares the availability of intrinsic vibrotactile feedback in traditional acoustic musical instruments with the lack of vibrotactile feedback in most digital musical instruments. A short description of human sensory ability with regard to this form of feedback is given and the usefullness of vibrotactile feedback to musical performers is also briefly discussed. A number of devices are examined which can be used to provide vibrotactile feedback in a digital musical instruments and some experiments to evaluate these devices are also described. Finally, examples are given of a number of instruments which make use of some of these devices to provide vibrotactile feedback to the performer.},

@article{ChoiKuchenbecker2013,
abstract = {This paper reviews the technology and applications of vibrotactile display, an effective information transfer modality for the emerging area of haptic media. Our emphasis is on summarizing foundational knowledge in this area and providing implementation guidelines for application designers who do not yet have a background in haptics. Specifically, we explain the relevant human vibrotactile perceptual capabilities, detail the main types of commercial vibrotactile actuators, and describe how to build both monolithic and localized vibrotactile displays. We then identify exemplary vibrotactile display systems in application areas ranging from the presentation of physical object properties to broadcasting vibrotactile media content.},
