abstract = {A recursive filter adopted for online eddy covariance analysis of turbulence data in the atmospheric surface layer is revisited, and its properties and performance are evaluated by means of concepts and methods developed in digital signal analysis. A rigorous estimate of effective cut-off frequency is derived along with an estimate of filter induced phase lag. Accordingly, filter design criteria are revised and various effects of parameter choice are assessed. Furthermore suitable corrections for compensating filter induced distortion, i.e., phase lag and attenuation, are proposed. The modified filter is tested on: (a) An artificial time series (random noise superimposed to 'slow' sinusoidal signal); (b) turbulence data from field measurements. In case (a) the retrieval of input signal parameters is appreciably improved. In case (b) a better agreement with a Gaussian moving average is obtained, at lower computational cost.},

abstract = {Magnetic and inertial measurement units are an emerging technology to obtain 3D orientation of body segments in human movement analysis. In this respect, sensor fusion is used to limit the drift errors resulting from the gyroscope data integration by exploiting accelerometer and magnetic aiding sensors. The present study aims at investigating the effectiveness of sensor fusion methods under different experimental conditions. Manual and locomotion tasks, differing in time duration, measurement volume, presence/absence of static phases, and out-of-plane movements, were performed by six subjects, and recorded by one unit located on the forearm or the lower trunk, respectively. Two sensor fusion methods, representative of the stochastic (Extended Kalman Filter) and complementary (Non-linear observer) filtering, were selected, and their accuracy was assessed in terms of attitude (pitch and roll angles) and heading (yaw angle) errors using stereophotogrammetric data as a reference. The sensor fusion approaches provided significantly more accurate results than gyroscope data integration. Accuracy improved mostly for heading and when the movement exhibited stationary phases, evenly distributed 3D rotations, it occurred in a small volume, and its duration was greater than approximately 20 s. These results were independent from the specific sensor fusion method used. Practice guidelines for improving the outcome accuracy are provided.},

@article{Mahony2008,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {In the medical field triaxial accelerometers are used for the monitoring of movements. Unfortunately, the long-term use of accelerometers is limited by drift of the sensitivities and the offsets. Therefore, a calibration procedure is designed which allows in-use calibration of a triaxial accelerometer. This procedure uses the fact that the modulus of the acceleration vector measured with a triaxial accelerometer equals lg under quasi-static conditions. The calibration procedure requires no explicit knowledge of the actual orientation of the triaxial accelerometer with respect to gravity and requires only quasi-static random movements. The procedure can be performed within several minutes. Considering practical applications, it is found possible to obtain an average error smaller than 3{\%} (of 1 [g] ) with the calibration procedure for inputs caused by ‘standing straight and moving slightly' when the offsets only are estimated. For the input caused by the sequence that occurs when going to bed, it is found possible to obtain errors smaller than 3{\%} for estimating all parameters. 0 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Since the proposed algorithm represents attitude as a unit quaternion, all basic tools used, including the standard UKF, are adapted to the unit quaternion algebra. Additionally, the algorithm adopts an outlier detector algorithm to identify abrupt changes in the UKF innovation and an adaptive strategy based on covariance matching to tune the measurement covariance matrix online. Adaptation and outlier detection make the proposed algorithm robust to fast and slow perturbations such as magnetic field interference and linear accelerations. Experimental results with a manipulator robot suggest that our method overcomes other algorithms found in the literature.},

abstract = {Measurements from magnetometers and inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) can be combined to give 3D orientation estimates. In order to obtain accurate orientation estimates it is imperative that the magnetometer and inertial sensor axes are aligned and that the magnetometer is properly calibrated for both sensor errors as well as presence of magnetic distortions. In this work we derive an easy-to-use calibration algorithm that can be used to calibrate a combination of a magnetometer and inertial sensors. The algorithm compensates for any static magnetic distortions created by the sensor plat- form, magnetometer sensor errors and determines the alignment between the magnetometer and the inertial sensor axes. The resulting calibration procedure does not require any additional hardware. We make use of probabilistic models and obtain the calibration algorithm as the solution to a maximum likelihood problem. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using experimental data collected from a sensor unit placed in a magnetically disturbed environment onboard a jet aircraft.},

abstract = {Orientation estimation using low cost sensors is an important task for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in order to obtain a good feedback for the attitude controller. The challenges come from the low accuracy and noisy data of the MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) technology, which is the basis of modern, miniaturized inertial sensors. In this article, we describe a novel approach to obtain an estimation of the orientation in quaternion form from the observations of gravity and magnetic field. Our approach provides a quaternion estimation as the algebraic solution of a system from inertial/magnetic observations. We separate the problems of finding the “tilt” quaternion and the heading quaternion in two sub-parts of our system. This procedure is the key for avoiding the impact of the magnetic disturbances on the roll and pitch components of the orientation when the sensor is surrounded by unwanted magnetic flux. We demonstrate the validity of our method first analytically and then empirically using simulated data. We propose a novel complementary filter for MAVs that fuses together gyroscope data with accelerometer and magnetic field readings. The correction part of the filter is based on the method described above and works for both IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the filter and show that it significantly outperforms other common methods, using publicly available datasets with ground-truth data recorded during a real flight experiment of a micro quadrotor helicopter.},

abstract = {This technical note provides the mathematics, reference source code and guidance for engineers implementing a tilt-compensated electronic compass (eCompass). The eCompass uses a three-axis accelerometer and threeaxis magnetometer. The accelerometer measures the components of the earth's gravity and the magnetometer measures the components of earth's magnetic field (the geomagnetic field). Since both the accelerometer and magnetometer are fixed on the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), their readings change according to the orientation of the PCB. If the PCB remains flat, then the compass heading could be computed from the arctangent of the ratio of the two horizontal magnetic field components. Since, in general, the PCB will have an arbitrary orientation, the compass heading is a function of all three accelerometer readings and all three magnetometer readings. The tilt-compensated eCompass algorithm actually calculates all three angles (pitch, roll, and yaw or compass heading) that define the PCB orientation. The eCompass algorithms can therefore also be used to create a 3D Pointer with the pointing direction defined by the yaw and pitch angles.},

We use the three magnetometer outputs to build a total magnetic field of the target. This signal is decomposed into a set of orthonormal basis functions, out of which the dominant basis function is chosen as the detector. The detector provides output responses to any target magnetic moment orientation. We support the analysis by a computer simulation and real-world experimental results.

In this paper, we present a positioning systems based on inertial MEMS sensor which includes three-axis accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope and three-axis magnetometer. The system can help people get accurate positioning for indoor environments, also available for outdoors, because of its self-contained character. It is a foot wearable device with wireless network to transmit movement information to computer that can calculate the relative position and show the path walked by. The key concept of the positioning system is inertial navigation and dead reckoning technology. Since it needs twice-integration of the acceleration to get the position, the displacement will drift by time elapse. We make it only drift by distance increasing through gait phase analysis, a method called Zero-Velocity Update (ZVU). As the 'stand-still phase' is the key of the system performance, we mainly focus on getting accurate gait phase detection. We used decision tree here and the experimental results showed that we got a gait phase detection accuracy of 99.96{\%} and positioning accuracy of 97.37{\%}.},

A complete error model, including instrumentation errors (scale factors, nonorthogonality, and offsets) and magnetic deviations (soft and hard iron) on the host platform, is elaborated. An adaptive least squares estimator provides a consistent solution to the ellipsoid fitting problem and the magnetometer's calibration parameters are derived. The calibration is experimentally assessed with two artificial magnetic perturbations introduced close to the sensor on the host platform and without additional perturbation. In all configurations, the algorithm successfully converges to a good estimate of the said errors.

This paper develops a robust attitude filter model that determines when the accelerometers can be used as vector measurements by us- ing a time-dependent model of steadiness. Furthermore, a gyro measurement model is developed using a Gaussian random walk model as the basis for bounding bias estimates and rejecting improbable estimates that arise from slow dynamics or tran- sitioning from steady to dynamic motion. Monte-Carlo simulations using test cases with dynamic motion were performed to verify its performance. The bias is accu- rately tracked and gyro integration performance during unsteady motion ultimately improved.

The filter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The benefits of the filter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each filter update, (2) effective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters defined by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the filter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6 ◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8 ◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

The sensor consists of a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyro, and a 3- axis magnetometer. A digital motion processor is also used. To remove gyro drifts in the long run, a sensor fusion method is applied that combines accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer data. Before this data fusion, bias removal of accelerometer and calibration of magnetometer are carried out. The results of this sensor fusion are given to a virtual camera for real-time graphical rendering of the virtual environment. This program shows updates virtual images of the head-mounted display with 33 frames per second. The results show that the drift of gyro is reduced to less than 1.0 degrees over 3 minutes},

@article{Kok2017a,
abstract = {Abstract In recent years, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensors (3D accelerometers and 3D gyroscopes) have become widely available due to their small size and low cost. Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suffer from inte- gration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and filtering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman filter and complementary filter implementations. The quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated data.},

MAD sensors detect local disturbances in the magnetic field, which can be used to detect the existence of and to estimate the position of buried, hidden, or submerged objects, such as ore deposits or mines. These sensors may experience false positive and false negative detections and, without prior knowledge of the targets, can only determine proximity to a target. The uncertainty in the sensors, coupled with a lack of knowledge of even the existence of targets, makes the estimation and control problems challenging. We utilize a hierarchical decomposition of the environment, coupled with an estimation algorithm based on random finite sets, to determine the number of and the locations of targets in the environment. The small team of robots follow the gradient of mutual information between the estimated set of targets and the future measurements, locally maximizing the rate of information gain. We present experimental results of a team of quadrotor micro aerial vehicles discovering and localizing an unknown number of permanent magnets.},

Accurate estimation of orientation and velocity through computationally cheap IMU data processing allows a representative characterization of human behavior patterns in this case. Thanks to tests performed among different subjects, results show that events are robustly detected 89{\%} of the cases and that activities are recognized with a success rate of 92{\%}. What is more, adequate rejection of noisy movements has also been achieved 94{\%} of the time. Thus, an efficient and robust solution for human physical activity tracking is presented.},

Some applications need information of acceleration and attitude with a high accuracy. For example, MEMS magnetometers and accelerometers can be integrated in embedded like mobile phones and GPS receivers. The parameters of such sensors must be precisely estimated to avoid drift and biased values. Thus, calibration is an important step to correctly use these sensors and get the expected measurements. This paper presents the theoretical and experimental steps of a method to compute gains, bias and non orthogonality factors of magnetometer and accelerometer sensors. This method of calibration can be used for automatic calibration in embedded systems.

abstract = {Magnetometer and inertial sensors are widely used for orientation estimation. Magnetometer usage is often troublesome, as it is prone to be interfered by onboard or ambient magnetic disturbance. The onboard soft-iron material distorts not only the magnetic field, but also the magnetometer sensor frame coordinate and the cross-sensor misalignment relative to inertial sensors. It is desirable to conveniently put magnetic and inertial sensors information in a common frame. Existing methods either split the problem into successive intrinsic and cross-sensor calibrations, or rely on stationary accelerometer measurements which are infeasible in dynamic conditions. This brief formulates the magnetometer calibration and alignment to inertial sensors as a state estimation problem, and collectively solves the magnetometer intrinsic and cross-sensor calibrations, as well as the gyroscope bias estimation. Sufficient conditions are derived for the problem to be globally observable, even when no accelerometer information is used at all. An extended Kalman filter is designed to implement the state estimation and comprehensive test data results show the superior performance of the proposed approach. It is immune to acceleration disturbance and applicable potentially in any dynamic conditions.},
