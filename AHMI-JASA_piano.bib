abstract = {High-level pianists refer to and can identify nuances in timbre by way of a wide and rich vocabulary, whose abstract, imaged, and metaphoric terms acutely designate a variety of sounds. This timbre-describing lexicon is hereby studied quantitatively. The semantic proximity between pairs taken among 14 common piano timbre descriptors was evaluated in questionnaires distributed to 17 pianists. Ratings were analyzed with multidimensional scaling algorithms, yielding a four-dimensional space representing the semantic proximity between descriptors. Using cluster analyses, five main subsets were identified, within which the most familiar terms were selected. We thus obtained five descriptors which optimally describe the whole semantic space for the group of pianists taking part in this study: bright, dry, dark, round, and velvety.},

abstract = {Timbre is an essential expressive feature in piano performance. Concert pianists use a vast palette of timbral nuances to color their performances at the microstructural level. Although timbre is generally envisioned in the pianistic community as an abstract concept carried through an imaged vocabulary, performers may share some common strategies of timbral expression in piano performance. Yet there may remain further leeway for idiosyncratic processes in the production of piano timbre nuances. In this study, we examined the patterns of timbral expression in performances by four expert pianists. Each pianist performed four short pieces, each with five different timbral intentions (bright, dark, dry, round, and velvety). The performances were recorded with the high-accuracy B{\"{o}}sendorfer CEUS system. Fine-grained performance features of dynamics, touch, articulation and pedaling were extracted. Reduced PCA performance spaces and descriptive performance portraits confirmed that pianists exhibited unique, specific profiles for different timbral intentions, derived from underlying traits of general individuality, while sharing some broad commonalities of dynamics and articulation for each timbral intention. These results confirm that pianists' abstract notions of timbre correspond to reliable patterns of performance technique. Furthermore, these effects suggest that pianists can express individual styles while complying with specific timbral intentions.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents an interdisciplinary, systematic study of the expression of piano timbre by advanced-level pianists in the context of musical performance and prac- tice. To begin, general issues and aims are introduced, as well as differing definitions and perspectives on piano timbre from scientific and musical points of view. After the conception of piano timbre is presented as documented by pianists in pedagogical trea- tises, the perception and verbalisation of piano timbre is investigated with experimental and quantitative scientific methods. The words that pianists use to describe and talk about different timbral nuances are studied quantitatively, according to their semantic relationships, and a semantic map of common piano timbre descriptors is drawn out. In two separate studies, the perception of piano timbre by highly skilled pianists is investi- gated. Results suggest that advanced pianists can identify and label performer-controlled timbral nuances in audio recordings with consistency and agreement from production to perception. Finally, the production and gestural control of piano timbre in musical per- formance is explored using the B{\"{o}}sendorfer CEUS piano performance recording system.The PianoTouch toolbox, specifically developed inMATLABfor extracting performance features from high-resolution keyboard and pedalling data, is presented and used to study the expressive production of piano timbre through touch and gesture in CEUS-recorded performances by four pianists in five timbral nuances. Gestural spaces and portraits of the timbral nuances are obtained with differing patterns in intensity, attack, balance be- tween hands, articulation and pedalling. The data represents common strategies used for the expression of each timbral nuance in piano performance.},

abstract = {A synthesizer was constructed to produce simultaneously 100 pure tones with means for controlling the intensity and frequency of each one of them. The piano tones were analyzed by conventional apparatus and methods and the analysis set into the synthesizer. The analysis was considered correct only when a jury of eight listeners could not tell which were real and which were synthetic tones. Various kinds of synthetic tones were presented to the jury for comparison with real tones. A number of these were judged to have better quality than the real tones. According to these tests synthesized piano-like tones were produced when the attack time was less than 0.01 sec. The decay can be as long as 20 sec for the lower notes and be less than 1 sec for the very high ones. The best quality is produced when the partials decrease in level at the rate of 2 db per 100-cps increase in the frequency of the partial. The partials below middle C must be inharmonic in frequency to be piano-like.},
