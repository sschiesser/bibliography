abstract = {Gordon and Cooper (1975) have described an interesting tactile phenomenon. The orientation of undulations on the surface of an object can be detected more accurately when a person moves an intermediate paper over the surface than when the bare fingers are used. Counter to a prediction derived from Gordon and Cooper's explanation of their results, the present studies show that the apparent roughness of a surface increases when a similar manner of touching is used. The first two experiments confirm the latter observation. To explain the alteration in perceived roughness (and more tentatively, Gordon and Cooper's own findings), it is proposed that surface roughness (and undulations) are masked by shear forces applied to the skin. Two informal tests and a third experiment support this interpretation. Alternative explanations and a practical application for the blind are also considered.},

abstract = {Oscillatory motions of handles, seats, and floors produce complex patterns of sensations in the body with the detection of these motions dependent on the sensitivity of the body to the applied vibration. This study examined the effect of input location (the hand, the seat, and the foot) and vibration frequency (8-315 Hz at the hand and foot; 2-315 Hz at the seat) on absolute thresholds for the perception of vibration in each of three axes (fore-and-aft, lateral, and vertical). Perception thresholds were determined with 96 males aged 20-29 years divided into eight groups of 12 subjects; each group received vibration at either the hand, the seat, or the foot in one of the three axes (one group experienced both lateral and vertical vibration at the hand). A frequency dependence in the thresholds was apparent for each of the three directions at each of the three locations; U-shaped acceleration threshold contours at frequencies greater than 80 Hz suggest the same psychophysical channel-mediated high-frequency thresholds at the hand, the seat, and the foot. Among the nine axes, sensitivity was greatest for vertical vibration at the seat at frequencies between 8 and 80 Hz, whereas sensitivity was greatest for vertical vibration at the hand at frequencies greater than 100 Hz. Absolute thresholds for the perception of vibration at the hand, the seat, and the foot are not consistent with the relevant frequency weightings in current standards. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A scale of vibration greatness (VG) corresponding to loudness (sone) in psycho-acoustics was determined on the whole body and hand vibrations in vertical and hor-izontal directions. This scale has true ratio properties, and numbers on this scale having a given ratio refer to vibrations whose sensation has that ratio. The corrected ratio method devised by W. R. Garner for loudness measurement was used in our ex-periment. This method consists of two experiments which are based on fractionation and equisection judgments. The unit value of VG was decided as 40 VGL (1 VG=40 VGL). Vibration greatness level (VGL) corresponds to loudness level (phon) as defined in Part 1. The experiments were carried out mainly at 20c/s. The effect of frequency on vibration greatness was examined at 5, 30 and 60 c/s. The vibration greatness for both of whole body and hand can be shown by following two equations. log VG = 0. 030 VGL-1.20, below 1 VG. log VG = 0. 023 VGL-0.92, above 1 VG. Dependency on frequency was not observed.},

The results show that the data obtained by direct scaling are comparable to the data obtained by interfrequency matching. The subjective magnitude function is a power function with a slope of about 0.89 for frequencies up to 350 Hz. Near threshold the growth of sensation is proportional to the physical intensity.

abstract = {Learning to play a musical instrument requires complex multimodal skills involving simultaneous perception of several sensory modalities: auditory, visual, somatosensory, as well as the motor system. Therefore, musical training provides a good and adequate neuroscientific model to study multimodal brain plasticity effects in humans. Here, we investigated the impact of short-term unimodal and multimodal musical training on brain plasticity. Two groups of nonmusicians were musically trained over the course of 2 weeks. One group [sensorimotor-auditory (SA)] learned to play a musical sequence on the piano, whereas the other group [auditory (A)] listened to and made judgments about the music that had been played by participants of the sensorimotor-auditory group. Training-induced cortical plasticity was assessed by recording the musically elicited mismatch negativity (MMNm) from magnetoencephalographic measurements before and after training. SA and A groups showed significantly different cortical responses after training. Specifically, the SA group showed significant enlargement of MMNm after training compared with the A group, reflecting greater enhancement of musical representations in auditory cortex after sensorimotor-auditory training compared with after mere auditory training. Thus, we have experimentally demonstrated that not only are sensorimotor and auditory systems connected, but also that sensorimotor-auditory training causes plastic reorganizational changes in the auditory cortex over and above changes introduced by auditory training alone.},

abstract = {Many traditional musical instruments are inherently designed to display vibrotactile information, in addition to the auditory information. For example, the vibration of a string on a violin or the reed of a clarinet can be felt. This non-auditory information enriches the playing experience, and is thought to be used to improve articulation in producing sound. Unlike acoustical instruments, electronic musical instruments display a synthetic sound source, which in fact can only be heard and not felt. Tactually displaying attributes of the sound (e.g., pitch, volume envelope, timbre) enables the performer to improve muscular control. In the talk several technologies for enhancing tactual display of the sound source, as well as ways of control will be described. For example, input devices such as gloves and gesture trackers and other technologies were adapted from virtual reality research. These developments led to the realisation that the link between sound source and its "feel" was missing. For instance, a sharp sound should have a clearly tangible threshold, and a dull sound a more soft feel. The work described here was mainly previously conducted at the Sonology Institute of the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, in co-operation with STEIM (Studio for Electro-Instrumental Music) in Amsterdam},

Stimuli with audio delays in the range of –26 to 51 ms were judged synchronous. In the second experiment, the judgement was whether the auditory stimulus and the tactile stimulus were synchronous or asynchronous. The results showed that stimuli with audio delays in the range of –24 to 50 ms were judged synchronous. In the third experiment the subjects had to judge whether the audio stimulus preceded the tactile stimulus, or the tactile stimulus preceded the audio stimulus.

To demonstrate this approach to evaluation, the mode of geometric perception was evaluated for a point force device. Twelve observers performed a shape recognition task using a PHANToM display. The task proved difficult, with a mean recognition time of 22 s. This class of devices does not appear to support adequate performance for applications that require geometric perception.

abstract = {Although previous physiological and anatomical experiments have identified four afferent fiber types (PC, RA, SA II, and SA I) in glabrous (nonhairy) skin of the human somatosensory periphery, only three have been shown to mediate tactile (mechanoreceptive) sensation. Psychophysical evidence that four channels (P, NP I, NP II, and NP III) do, indeed, participate in the perceptual process is presented. In a series of experiments involving selective masking of the various channels, modification of the skin-surface temperature, and testing cutaneous sensitivity down to very low-vibratory frequencies, the fourth psychophysical channel (NP III) is defined. Based on these experiments and previous work from our laboratory, it is concluded that the four channels work in conjunction at threshold to create an operating range for the perception of vibration that extends from at least 0.4 to greater than 500 Hz. Each of the four channels appears to mediate specific portions of the overall threshold-frequency characteristic. Selection of appropriate neural-response criteria from previously published physiological data and correlation of their derived frequency characteristics with the four psychophysical channels indicates that each channel has its own physiological substrate: P channel and PC fibers, NP I channel and RA fibers, NP II channel and SA II fibers, and NP III channel and SA I fibers. These channels partially overlap in their absolute sensitivities, making it likely that suprathreshold stimuli may activate two or more of the channels at the same time. Thus the perceptual qualities of touch may be determined by the combined inputs from four channels.},

@article{Mahns2006,
abstract = {The human capacity for vibrotactile frequency discrimination has been compared directly for glabrous and hairy skin regions by means of a two-alternative, forced-choice psychophysical procedure in five subjects. Sinusoidal vibratory stimuli, delivered by means of a 4-mm-diam probe, were first used to obtain detection threshold values for the two skin sites, the finger tip and the dorsal forearm, at four standard frequencies, 20, 50, 100, and 200 Hz. Values confirmed previous results showing detection thresholds were markedly higher on hairy skin than on glabrous skin. For the discrimination task, each standard frequency, at an amplitude four times detection threshold, was paired with a series of comparison frequencies, and discrimination capacity then was quantified by deriving from psychometric function curves, measures of the discriminable frequency increment ($\Delta$ƒ) and the Weber Fraction ($\Delta$ƒ/ƒ), which, when plotted as a function of the four standard frequencies, revealed similar capacities for frequency discrimination at the two skin sites at the standard frequencies of 20, 100, and 200 Hz but an equivocal difference at 50 Hz. Cutaneous local anesthesia produced a marked impairment in vibrotactile detection and discrimination at the low standard frequencies of 20 and 50 Hz but little effect at higher frequencies. In summary, the results reveal, first, a striking similarity in vibrotactile discriminative performance in hairy and glabrous skin despite marked differences in detection thresholds for the two sites, and, second, the results confirm that vibrotactile detection and discrimination in hairy skin depend on superficial receptors at low frequencies but depend on deep, probably Pacinian corpuscle, receptors for high frequencies.},

abstract = {Low frequency vibrations can be detected by both tactile and auditory systems. The aim of the present study is to find out, by means of whole-scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG), whether vibrotactile stimulation alone would activate human auditory cortical areas. We recorded MEG signals from eleven normal-hearing adults to 200-Hz vibrations (on average 19.5 dB above the individual tactile detection threshold), delivered to right-hand fingertips. All subjects reported a perception of a sound when they touched the vibrating tube, and they reported to perceive nothing when not touching the tube. The vibrotactile stimuli elicited clear and reproducible vibrotactile evoked fields (VTEFs) in ten subjects, whereas no MEG responses were observed when the tube was not touched. First responses to the vibrotactile stimuli, peaking around 60 ms, originated in the primary somatosensory cortex in all subjects. They were followed by activations in the auditory cortices, either bilaterally (N = 5) or unilaterally (N = 5), and by activations in the secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex, either contralaterally (N = 3) or ipsilaterally (N = 4). Both the SII and auditory activations consisted of transient responses at 100-200 ms. Additional auditory sustained activation was identified in nine subjects, either bilaterally (N = 2) or ipsilaterally (N = 7), at 200-700 ms. Our results suggest convergence of vibrotactile input to the auditory cortex in normal-hearing adults, in agreement with results previously obtained in a congenitally deaf adult. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Although hand-transmitted vibration causes injury and disease, most often evident in the fingers, the biodynamic responses of the fingers, hand, and arm are not yet well understood. A method of investigating the motion of the entire finger-hand-arm system, based on the simultaneous measurement of the biodynamic response at the driving point and the transmissibility to many points on the finger-hand-arm system, is illustrated. Fourteen male subjects participated in an experiment in which they pushed down on a vertically vibrating metal plate with their right forearm pronated and their elbow bent at 90°. The apparent mass and mechanical impedance of the finger-hand-arm system were measured for each of seven different contact conditions between the plate and the fingers and hand. Simultaneously, the vibration of the fingers, hand, and arm was measured at 41 locations using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. Transmissibilities showed how the vibration was transmitted along the arm and allowed the construction of spectral operating deflection shapes showing the vibration pattern of the fingers, hand, and arm for each of the seven contact conditions. The vibration patterns at critical frequencies for each contact condition have been used to explain features in the driving point biodynamic responses and the vibration behaviour of the hand-arm system. Spectral operating deflection shapes for the upper limb assist the interpretation of driving point biodynamic responses and help to advance understanding required to predict, explain, and control the various effects of hand-transmitted vibration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

All subjects were carefully screened for confounding medical variables, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and diabetes. The measurements were performed over the frequency range of 4–400 Hz in the laboratory to permit careful control of physical variables, such as orientation of the vibrating probe with respect to the finger tip, contact force, and hand movement. Preliminary analysis of our results, together with those of others, suggests that the neurological component of the hand‐arm vibration syndrome develops first as a change in the threshold of Pacinian corpuscles, which later spreads to the other cutaneous mechanoreceptors.},

@article{Liu2016,
abstract = {Most real-world events stimulate multiple sensory modalities simultaneously. Usually, the stiffness of an object is perceived haptically. However, auditory signals also contain stiff- ness-related information, and people can form impressions of stiffness from the different impact sounds of metal, wood, or glass. To understand whether there is any interaction between auditory and haptic stiffness perception, and if so, whether the inferred material category is the most relevant auditory information, we conducted experiments using a force- feedback device and the modal synthesis method to present haptic stimuli and impact sound in accordance with participants' actions, and to modulate low-level acoustic parame- ters, i.e., frequency and damping, without changing the inferred material categories of sound sources. We found that metal sounds consistently induced an impression of stiffer surfaces than did drum sounds in the audio-only condition, but participants haptically per- ceived surfaces with modulated metal sounds as significantly softer than the same surfaces with modulated drum sounds, which directly opposes the impression induced by these sounds alone. This result indicates that, although the inferred material category is strongly associated with audio-only stiffness perception, low-level acoustic parameters, especially damping, are more tightly integrated with haptic signals than the material category is. Fre- quency played an important role in both audio-only and audio-haptic conditions. Our study provides evidence that auditory information influences stiffness perception differently in uni- sensory and multisensory tasks. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that sounds with higher frequency and/or shorter decay time tended to be judged as stiffer, and contact sounds of stiff objects had no effect on the haptic perception of soft surfaces. We argue that the intrinsic physical relationship between object stiffness and acoustic parameters may be applied as prior knowledge to achieve robust estimation of stiffness in multisensory perception.},

In a task which required a large amount of cognitive processing. it became difficult for subjects to maintain high levels of performance in both modalities and the distribution of attention became an important determinant of performance.

abstract = {Acoustic speech is easier to detect in noise when the talker can be seen. This finding could be explained by integration of multisensory inputs or refinement of auditory processing from visual guidance. In two experiments, we studied two-interval forced-choice detection of an auditory 'ba' in acoustic noise, paired with various visual and tactile stimuli that were identically presented in the two observation intervals. Detection thresholds were reduced under the multisensory conditions vs. the auditory-only condition, even though the visual and/or tactile stimuli alone could not inform the correct response. Results were analysed relative to an ideal observer for which intrinsic (internal) noise and efficiency were independent contributors to detection sensitivity. Across experiments, intrinsic noise was unaffected by the multisensory stimuli, arguing against the merging (integrating) of multisensory inputs into a unitary speech signal, but sampling efficiency was increased to varying degrees, supporting refinement of knowledge about the auditory stimulus. The steepness of the psychometric functions decreased with increasing sampling efficiency, suggesting that the 'task-irrelevant' visual and tactile stimuli reduced uncertainty about the acoustic signal. Visible speech was not superior for enhancing auditory speech detection. Our results reject multisensory neuronal integration and speech-specific neural processing as explanations for the enhanced auditory speech detection under noisy conditions. Instead, they support a more rudimentary form of multisensory interaction: the otherwise task-irrelevant sensory systems inform the auditory system about when to listen.},

In Experiment 1, participants had to discriminate the direction of an auditory stream (consisting of the sequential presentation of two tones from different spatial positions) while attempting to ignore a task-irrelevant tactile stream (consisting of the sequential presentation of two vibrations, one to each of the participant's hands). The tactile stream presented to the participants' hands was either spatiotemporally congruent or incongruent with respect to the sounds. A significant decrease in performance in incongruent trials compared with congruent trials was demonstrated when the participants adopted an uncrossed-hands posture but not when their hands were crossed over the midline. In Experiment 2, we investigated the ability of participants to discriminate the direction of two sequentially presented tactile stimuli (one presented to each hand) as a function of the presence of congruent vs incongruent auditory distractors. Here, the crossmodal effect was stronger in the crossed-hands posture than in the uncrossed-hands posture. These results demonstrate the reciprocal nature of audiotactile interactions in spatiotemporal processing, and highlight the important role played by body posture in modulating such crossmodal interactions.},

abstract = {The ability of observers to detect temporal gaps in bursts of sinusoids or bursts of band-limited noise was measured to assess the temporal acuity of Pacinian (P) and non-Pacinian (NP) tactile information processing channels. The P channel was isolated by delivering high frequency sinusoids or high frequency noise through a large 1.5-cm2 contactor to the thenar eminence. The NP channels were isolated from the P channel by delivering these stimuli as well as stimuli with lower frequencies through a small 0.01-cm2 contactor to the same site. Gap detection thresholds were higher for gaps in noise than for gaps in sinusoids but did not differ among conditions designed to isolate P and NP channels. The finding that temporal acuity does not differ among channels supports the hypothesis that, after termination of a stimulus, the P and NP channels exhibit the same amount of neural persistence. Also consistent with this hypothesis are the earlier findings that the enhancement of the sensation magnitude of a stimulus by a prior stimulus (Verrillo and Gescheider, Percept Psychophys 18: 128-136, 1975) and the duration of sensation after the termination of a stimulus (Gescheider et al., J Acoust Soc Am 91: 1690-1696, 1992) are independent of stimulus frequency. One important implication of this hypothesis, if true, is that the presence of temporal summation in the P channel and its absence in the NP channels, results, not from the lack of neural persistence in the NP channels, but instead, in marked contrast to the P channel, from the lack of a mechanism for integrating persistent neural activity over time.},

This information can be inferred from electromyography (EMG) of the forearm, measuring the activation of the muscles controlling the hand and fingers. We present TouchSense, which classifies the finger touches using a novel neural network architecture and estimates their force on a smartphone in real time based on data recorded from the sensors of an inexpensive and wireless EMG armband. Using data collected from 18 participants with force ground truth, we evaluate our system's performance and limitations.

abstract = {Performances of memorized piano compositions unfold via dynamic integrations of motor, perceptual, cognitive, and emotive operations. The functional neuroanatomy of such elaborately skilled achievements was characterized in the present study by using (15)0-water positron emission tomography to image blindfolded pianists performing a concerto by J.S. Bach. The resulting brain activity was referenced to that for bimanual performance of memorized major scales. Scales and concerto performances both activated primary motor cortex, corresponding somatosensory areas, inferior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, motor cingulate, bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex, right thalamus, anterior and posterior cerebellum. Regions specifically supporting the concerto performance included superior and middle temporal cortex, planum polare, thalamus, basal ganglia, posterior cerebellum, dorsolateral premotor cortex, right insula, right supplementary motor area, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Areas specifically implicated in generating and playing scales were posterior cingulate, middle temporal, right middle frontal, and right precuneus cortices, with lesser increases in right hemispheric superior temporal, temporoparietal, fusiform, precuneus, and prefrontal cortices, along with left inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, much greater deactivations were present for playing the concerto than scales. This seems to reflect a deeper attentional focus in which tonically active orienting and evaluative processes, among others, are suspended. This inference is supported by observed deactivations in posterior cingulate, parahippocampus, precuneus, prefrontal, middle temporal, and posterior cerebellar cortices. For each of the foregoing analyses, a distributed set of interacting localized functions is outlined for future test.},

Our experiments indicate that under certain conditions, both mechanisms may operate, but that the process of neural integration is an exclusive characteristic of the Pacinian (P) channel. The P channel was isolated by applying 250 Hz stimuli through a 1.5 cm2 contactor to the thenar eminence of the hand and the NPII channel was isolated by applying the stimuli through a 0.01 cm2 contactor. The finding that the slopes of the psychometric functions were the same within both channels indicated that probability summation could not account for temporal summation for stimulus durations less than 1 s. The finding that the threshold for the detection of multiple-pulse stimuli increased as the interpulse interval increased indicated that, for time intervals less than 800 ms, temporal summation results from neural integration. But for interstimulus intervals greater than 800 ms, probability summation accounts for temporal summation.},

abstract = {In many occupational and leisure environments, the human body is exposed to oscillatory motions of handles, seats and floors which give rise to complex patterns of sensations. Knowledge of differences in sensitivity to the perception of vibration at the hand, seat and foot would assist the identification of sources of discomfort caused by vibration. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of vibration frequency (8 to 315 Hz for the hand and foot, 2 to 315 Hz for the seat) and input location (the hand, seat and foot) on thresholds for perception of vertical vibration. Perception thresholds were determined with 36 males aged 20 to 30 years divided into three groups of 12 subjects; each group received vertical vibration at either the hand, or the seat, or the foot. At frequencies less than 50 Hz, sensitivity to vertical vibration at the seat was the greatest and sensitivity to vertical vibration at the hand was least (p{\textless}0.04). The differences in median sensitivity between the three locations were greatest at low frequencies: at 50 Hz the ratios of perception thresholds (ms -2 r.m.s) for the three inputs were about 1.0 (seat):1.5 (foot):3.0 (hand); at 10 Hz the ratios were 1.0 (seat):3.0 (foot):5.0 (hand). A similarity in the shapes of the threshold contours at frequencies greater than 80 Hz suggests the same psychophysical channel mediated high frequency thresholds at the hand, seat and foot.},

We study force-sensitive tapping using Expressive Touch, a tabletop interface that infers tapping force from the sound waves created by the users' finger upon impact. The first part of the paper describes the implementation details of Expressive Touch and shows how ex- isting tabletop interfaces can be augmented to reliably detect tapping force across the entire surface. The second part of the paper reports on the results of three studies of force-sensitive tapping. First, we use a classic psychophysic task to gain insights into participants' perception of tapping force (Study 1). Results show that although participants tap with differ- ent absolute tapping forces, they have a similar perception of relative tapping force. Second, we investigate participants' ability to control tapping force (Study 2) and find that users can produce two force levels with 99{\%} accuracy. For six levels of force, accuracy drops to 58{\%}. Third, we investigate the usability of force tapping by studying participants' reactions to seven force-sensitive touch applications (Study 3).},

@article{Adams2013,
abstract = {Many aspects of both grip function and tactile perception depend on complex frictional interactions occurring in the contact zone of the finger pad, which is the subject of the current review. While it is well established that friction plays a crucial role in grip function, its exact contribution for discriminatory touch involving the sliding of a finger pad is more elusive. For texture discrimination, it is clear that vibrotaction plays an important role in the discriminatory mechanisms. Among other factors, friction impacts the nature of the vibrations generated by the relative movement of the fingertip skin against a probed object. Friction also has a major influence on the perceived tactile pleasantness of a surface. The contact mechanics of a finger pad is governed by the fingerprint ridges and the sweat that is exuded from pores located on these ridges. Counterintuitively, the coefficient of friction can increase by an order of magnitude in a period of tens of seconds when in contact with an impermeably smooth surface, such as glass. In contrast, the value will decrease for a porous surface, such as paper. The increase in friction is attributed to an occlusion mechanism and can be described by first-order kinetics. Surprisingly, the sensitivity of the coefficient of friction to the normal load and sliding velocity is comparatively of second order, yet these dependencies provide the main basis of theoretical models which, to-date, largely ignore the time evolution of the frictional dynamics. One well-known effect on taction is the possibility of inducing stick-slip if the friction decreases with increasing sliding velocity. Moreover, the initial slip of a finger pad occurs by the propagation of an annulus of failure from the perimeter of the contact zone and this phenomenon could be important in tactile perception and grip function.},

The combination of our new sensor setup with pattern recognition techniques like the lately de- veloped ordered means models allows fast and precise recog- nition of highly skilled playing techniques. This includes left and right hand analysis as well as a combination of both. In this paper we show bow position recognition for string in- struments by means of support vector regression machines on the right hand finger pressure, as well as bowing recog- nition and inaccurate playing detection with ordered means models. We also introduce a new left hand and chin pressure sensing method for coordination and position change anal- ysis. Our methods in combination with our audio, video, and gesture recording software can be used for teaching and exercising. Especially studies of complex movements and finger force distribution changes can benefit from such an approach. Practical applications include the recognition of inaccuracy, cramping, or malposition, and, last but not least, the development of augmented instruments and new playing techniques.},

abstract = {Perceptual integration of vibrotactile and auditory sinusoidal tone pulses was studied in detection experiments as a function of stimulation frequency. Vibrotactile stimuli were delivered through a single channel vibrator to the left middle fingertip. Auditory stimuli were presented diotically through headphones in a background of 50 dB sound pressure level broadband noise. Detection performance for combined auditory-tactile presentations was measured using stimulus levels that yielded 63{\%} to 77{\%} correct unimodal performance. In Experiment 1, the vibrotactile stimulus was 250 Hz and the auditory stimulus varied between 125 and 2000 Hz. In Experiment 2, the auditory stimulus was 250 Hz and the tactile stimulus varied between 50 and 400 Hz. In Experiment 3, the auditory and tactile stimuli were always equal in frequency and ranged from 50 to 400 Hz. The highest rates of detection for the combined-modality stimulus were obtained when stimulating frequencies in the two modalities were equal or closely spaced (and within the Pacinian range). Combined-modality detection for closely spaced frequencies was generally consistent with an algebraic sum model of perceptual integration; wider-frequency spacings were generally better fit by a Pythagorean sum model. Thus, perceptual integration of auditory and tactile stimuli at near-threshold levels appears to depend both on absolute frequency and relative frequency of stimulation within each modality.},

Existing guidelines are mainly concerned with passive displays, such as Braille labels on controls, nibs on keyboards and notches on smart cards [2, 3, 4]. In this paper we focus on active displays, either consisting of a single vibrating element (used in for example mobile phones and computer mice) or numerous elements (used in for example active Braille displays and body suits [5, 6]). This paper discusses a first set of guidelines, dealing with the basic vibro-tactile parameters. The set is mainly derived from neurophysiological and psychophysical data. The guidelines indicate the relevant parameters as well as possible pitfalls. As such they can serve as a point of departure for interface designers.

abstract = {This study examined the trainability of the proprioceptive sense and explored the relationship between proprioception and motor learning. With vision blocked, human learners had to perform goal-directed wrist movements relying solely on proprioceptive/haptic cues to reach several haptically specified targets. One group received additional somatosensory movement error feedback in form of vibro-tactile cues applied to the skin of the forearm. We used a haptic robotic device for the wrist and implemented a 3-day training regimen that required learners to make spatially precise goal-directed wrist reaching movements without vision. We assessed whether training improved the acuity of the wrist joint position sense. In addition, we checked if sensory learning generalized to the motor domain and improved spatial precision of wrist tracking movements that were not trained. The main findings of the study are: First, proprioceptive acuity of the wrist joint position sense improved after training for the group that received the combined proprioceptive/haptic and vibro-tactile feedback (VTF). Second, training had no impact on the spatial accuracy of the untrained tracking task. However, learners who had received VTF significantly reduced their reliance on haptic guidance feedback when performing the untrained motor task. That is, concurrent VTF was highly salient movement feedback and obviated the need for haptic feedback. Third, VTF can be also provided by the limb not involved in the task. Learners who received VTF to the contralateral limb equally benefitted. In conclusion, somatosensory training can significantly enhance proprioceptive acuity within days when learning is coupled with vibro-tactile sensory cues that provide feedback about movement errors. The observable sensory improvements in proprioception facilitates motor learning and such learning may generalize to the sensorimotor control of the untrained motor tasks. The implications of these findings for neurorehabilitation are discussed.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that motor-skill training over extended time periods results in reorganization of neural networks and changes in brain morphology. Yet, little is known about training-induced adaptive changes in the vocal system, which is largely subserved by intrinsic reflex mechanisms. We investigated highly accomplished opera singers, conservatory level vocal students, and laymen during overt singing of an Italian aria in a neuroimaging experiment. We provide the first evidence that the training of vocal skills is accompanied by increased functional activation of bilateral primary somatosensory cortex representing articulators and larynx. Opera singers showed additional activation in right primary sensorimotor cortex. Further training-related activation comprised the inferior parietal lobe and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. At the subcortical level, expert singers showed increased activation in the basal ganglia, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. A regression analysis of functional activation with accumulated singing practice confirmed that vocal skills training correlates with increased activity of a cortical network for enhanced kinesthetic motor control and sensorimotor guidance together with increased involvement of implicit motor memory areas at the subcortical and cerebellar level. Our findings may have ramifications for both voice rehabilitation and deliberate practice of other implicit motor skills that require interoception.},

abstract = {A measuring method for the vibration perception threshold (VPT) of fingers has been developed. The VPTs of 118 and 149 professional forest workers were measured during a compulsory annual health examination in 1979 and 1983, respectively. Also the VPTs of eight pedestal grinders, who were suffering vibration-induced white finger (VWF), were measured in 1979 and 1983. The control group consisted of 20 research workers who had no vibration exposure in the past and no symptoms in their hands. The measuring system for VPT gave repeatable results. The frequency of the most sensitive VPT of vibration exposed workers alternated between 63 and 125 Hz instead of 125 Hz of subjects without vibration exposure. The VPT of the pedestal grinders and forest workers with decreased hand grip force and with vibration-induced white finger were significantly higher than those of the controls. The VPTs of the forest workers decreased slightly and that of the grinders increased from 1979 to 1983. In spite of long vibration exposure in the past and continuing lower level vibration exposure, the increased VPT of forest workers does not seem to be permanent.},

abstract = {Timbre is an essential expressive feature in piano performance. Concert pianists use a vast palette of timbral nuances to color their performances at the microstructural level. Although timbre is generally envisioned in the pianistic community as an abstract concept carried through an imaged vocabulary, performers may share some common strategies of timbral expression in piano performance. Yet there may remain further leeway for idiosyncratic processes in the production of piano timbre nuances. In this study, we examined the patterns of timbral expression in performances by four expert pianists. Each pianist performed four short pieces, each with five different timbral intentions (bright, dark, dry, round, and velvety). The performances were recorded with the high-accuracy B{\"{o}}sendorfer CEUS system. Fine-grained performance features of dynamics, touch, articulation and pedaling were extracted. Reduced PCA performance spaces and descriptive performance portraits confirmed that pianists exhibited unique, specific profiles for different timbral intentions, derived from underlying traits of general individuality, while sharing some broad commonalities of dynamics and articulation for each timbral intention. These results confirm that pianists' abstract notions of timbre correspond to reliable patterns of performance technique. Furthermore, these effects suggest that pianists can express individual styles while complying with specific timbral intentions.},

abstract = {We investigated the relative effectiveness of tangential versus normal displacements of skin for producing tactile sensations. Subjects adjusted the magnitude of slow tangential and oblique displacements of a flat-ended, cylindrical, 1 mm diameter probe glued to the skin in order to match the perceived intensity of a reference displacement that indented the skin normal to the surface. At both the forearm and fingerpad, subjects chose tangential displacements only 0.3 to 0.6 times as large as the reference normal displacement, indicating a significantly higher sensitivity to tangential displacement. Based on measurements of the mechanical impedance of the skin to normal and tangential displacements, these results were also expressed in terms of forces. At the forearm, subjects were more sensitive to tangential forces than normal force. However, at the fingerpad, sensitivity to tangential forces was lower than sensitivity to normal force, due to the approximately five-fold greater stiffness of the fingerpad to tangential traction. These results provide guidance for development of tactile displays: (1) When an actuator is limited primarily in terms of peak displacement (e.g., the maximum strain of a ceramic piezoelectric actuator) then tangential stimulation is a superior choice for both body sites we tested. (2) When an actuator is limited primarily in terms of peak force (e.g., the stall torque of a DC micromotor) tangential stimulation is the superior choice for the hairy skin, but normal stimulation is the better choice on the fingerpad.},

Providing haptic feedback of variables relevant to manipulation, such as contact force, may thus improve the usability of prosthetic hands for tasks of daily living. Vibrotactile stimulation was explored as a feedback modality in ten unimpaired participants across eight sessions in a two-week period. Participants used their right index finger to perform a virtual object manipulation task with both visual and augmentative vibrotactile feedback related to force. Through repeated training, participants were able to learn to use the vibrotactile feedback to significantly improve object manipulation. Removal of vibrotactile feedback in session 8 significantly reduced task performance. These results suggest that vibrotactile feedback paired with training may enhance the manipulation ability of prosthetic hand users without the need for more invasive strategies.},

Differential thresholds were obtained for reference stimuli of 0.5 N, 0.25 N and near the individual threshold. Frequency, temperature, age, fingertip size, and contact force were investigated as parameters in a full-factorial design. Experiments were conducted with at least 27 subjects and a 1up-2down staircase procedure with 3IFC paradigm. We find absolute thresholds ranging from 1.7 mN to 19 mN with the lowest threshold at 320 Hz. Weber fractions from 18 dB to 41 dB are found near the absolute threshold. For larger references, they range from 4.9 dB to 23 dB. ANOVA finds frequency as significant medium effect for both absolute and differential thresholds. Results imply impact of age on the absolute threshold, but no effect of motor skill, temperature, fingertip size and contact force. Differential thresholds are affected by frequency only, which is attributed to saturation effects of the Pacinian channel. Fingertip size and motor skill are not able to explain effects on thresholds and the interpersonal variance. Results of this work are intended as requirement source for the design of task-specific haptic interfaces.},

Even children who did not have experience with all the instruments correctly identified the family of instruments they were listening to. The hypothesis of the second study, that musical instrument families function as a "basic level" in the instrument taxonomy, was confirmed. Variation in the basic level with varying expertise was documented in the third study with musicians. In the fourth study, children and adults identified the source of sounds from unfamiliar objects, Chinese musical instruments.

abstract = {Brisben, A. J., S. S. Hsiao, and K. O. Johnson. Detection of vibration transmitted through an object grasped in the hand. A tool or probe often functions as an extension of the hand, transmitting vibrations to the hand to produce a percept of the object contacting the tool or probe. This paper reports the psychophysical results of a combined psychophysical and neurophysiological study of the perception of vibration transmitted through a cylinder grasped in the hand. In the first part of the psychophysical study, 19 subjects grasped a cylinder, 32 mm diam, with an embedded motor that caused vibration parallel to the axis of the cylinder. The relationship between threshold and frequency was the traditional U-shaped function with a minimum between 150 and 200 Hz. Except a study by Bekesy in which subjects grasped a rod that vibrated parallel to the skin surface, thresholds above 20 Hz were lower and the slopes were steeper than any reported previously. Thresholds were {\textless}0.01 {\{}micro{\}}m in some subjects. Data from both the psychophysical and the neurophysiological studies suggest that detection performance at frequencies {\textgreater}20 Hz was based on activity in Pacinian afferents. The extreme sensitivity compared with previous reports may have resulted from differences in contact area, direction of vibration, contact force, and the shape of the stimulus probe. The effects of each of these variables were studied. At 40 and 300 Hz (frequencies near the lower and upper end of the Pacinian range) thresholds were 9.8 and 18.5 dB (68 and 88{\%}) lower, respectively, when subjects grasped the cylinder than when a 1-mm-diam probe vibrated perpendicular to the skin. These differences were accounted for as follows: 1) thresholds at a single fingerpad obtained with the large cylindrical surface were, on average, 20 and 60{\%} lower, respectively, than thresholds with the punctate probe; 2) thresholds at the palm were, on average, 15 and 40{\%} lower, respectively, than at the fingerpads; 3) thresholds obtained when the subjects grasped the cylinder averaged 40 and 20{\%} less, respectively, than when the cylinder contacted only the palm; 4) thresholds with the cylinder contacting two fingers were 10 and 30{\%} lower, respectively, than thresholds with the cylinder contacting a single finger; and 5) thresholds with vibration parallel to the skin surface were, on average, 10 and 30{\%} lower, respectively, than thresholds with vibration perpendicular to the skin. Contact force, which was varied from 0.05 to 1.0 N, had no effect.},
annote = {{\%} 1st experiment: grab cylinder with any force (not measured), vibration parallel to the axis of the cylinder, 1-up 2-down staircase. Results: {\$}{\textgreater} 20{\$} Hz thresholds are lower and the threshold-versus-frequency curves are steeper than any reported previously except those by Bekesy (1939), whose stimulus procedures were similar to those used in this study. Thresholds were {\$}{\textless} 0.01 \backslash, \backslashmu m{\$} in some subjects, average: {\$}0.03 \backslash, \backslashrm{\{}\backslashmu m{\}}{\$} between 150 and 200 Hz. Apart from Bekesy's results, the slope is steeper and the minimum threshold is lower than any in the literature.

{\%} (NB they had only 4 subjects!) Four more experiments were performed to determine how contact area, contact force (PASSIVE), direction of vibration, and the shape of the contactor affect this performance at low (40 Hz) and high (300 Hz) frequencies within the range served by Pacinian mechanisms. Except contact force, each of these factors affected detection performance. 
{\%} Considered contact forces (PASSIVE): 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 N. Because the forces that we and others (Lamore and Keemink 1988; Verrillo 1962) have used in psychophysical experiments are two to three orders of magnitude lower than forces that may occur in manual tasks, extending these investigations to higher forces is important. Increasing force beyond 1–2 N could lower thresholds by coupling transmitted vibrations to bones and tendons that might transmit the vibrations more effectively to distant Pacinian corpuscles. 
{\%} To determine whether there is a difference between perceptual capacity in active and passive touch, the stimulus conditions must be identical in the two conditions. Under these circumstances, the result has been either that the perceptual capacity is the same in the two circumstances (Vega-Bermudez et al. 1991) or that it is superior in the passive condition (Magee and Kennedy 1980). The explanation advanced for the latter finding is that active touch requires division of attention between the sensory and motor tasks (Magee and Kennedy 1980).},

abstract = {The perception of the mass and viscosity of an object is based on the dynamic forces applied to our hands when we jiggle or lift the object [1], [2], [3]. This force is commonly assumed to be sensed by kinetic receptors [4] in our muscles or tendons. When jiggling objects, we also experience the cutaneous deformation of our finger pads. In this study, we show that the dynamic vibration on the finger pad influences our perception of mass and viscosity. We experimentally confirm that the vibration on the finger pad, that synchronizes with the hand's accelerations or velocities, enhances the perceived changes in the mass or viscosity when the vibrotactile stimuli and the changes in the mass and viscosity are in the same perceptual direction. For example, when the increased mass and an acceleration-synchronized tactile stimulus{\&}{\#}x02014;which is a positive bias for the mass{\&}{\#}x02014;are simultaneously presented to the experiment participants, they respond that the perceived increase in the mass is enhanced. In contrast, when the tactile and proprioceptive stimuli are in perceptually opposite directions, the vibrotactile stimuli cancel the perceived changes in the mass and viscosity. In particular, the effect of the velocity-synchronized vibration on perception is stronger than the effect of the actual viscosity.},

abstract = {This paper presents evidences of the performance improvement due to perceptual-based force signal manipulation in an interaction task with an haptic device. We hypothesize that sub-threshold forces become perceivable when a vibration waveform is superimposed onto the force signal. We study the human capabilities in perception of harmonic forces, and we observe lower thresholds for sinusoidal waves than for onset force. Starting from these perceptual findings, we involve a frequency signal instead of a signal amplification to allow the tactile human sensors to sharpen the perception of sub-thresholds forces in a teleoperation task. We report on the results obtained from our experiments and on the method used to reach such goal.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile thresholds depend on the characteristics of the vibration, the location of contact with the skin, and the geometry of the contact with the skin. This experimental study investigated vibrotactile thresholds (from 8 to 250 Hz) at five locations on the distal phalanx of the finger with two contactors: (i) a 1-mm diameter circular probe (0.78-mm2 area) with a 1-mm gap to a fixed circular surround (i.e., 7.1-mm2 excitation area), and (ii) a 6-mm diameter circular probe (28-mm2 area) with a 2-mm gap to a fixed circular surround (i.e., 79-mm2 excitation area). With both contactors, especially the smaller contactor at low frequencies (i.e., 8, 16, and 31.5 Hz), thresholds decreased towards the tip of the finger, although there was little variation around the whorl. With low frequencies of vibration, and at all five locations on the finger, similar thresholds were obtained with both contactors, consistent with the NPI channel not changing in sensitivity with a change in the area of stimulation.

abstract = {What if the traditional relationship between touch and music was essentially turned upside down, making the tactile sen- sation the aesthetic end? This paper presents a novel coupling of haptics technology and music, introducing the notion of tactile composition or aesthetic composition for the sense of touch. A system that facilitates the composition and percep- tion of intricate, musically structured spatio-temporal pat- terns of vibration on the surface of the body is described. Relevant work from disciplines including sensory substi- tution, electronic musical instrument design, simulation design, entertainment technology, and visual music is con- sidered. The psychophysical parameter space for our sense of touch is summarized and the building blocks of a compo- sitional language for touch are explored. A series of concerts held for the skin and ears is described, as well as some of the lessons learned along the way. In conclusion, some potential evolutionary branches of tactile composition are posited.},

abstract = {We investigated how auditory and haptic information about the hardness of objects is integrated for the purpose of controlling the velocity with which we strike an object. Our experimental manipulations and data analyses considered a variety of factors that should be integrated in a theory of multisensory per- ception: expertise of the perceiver; context (unimodal vs. multimodal); between-modalities congruence; between-participants agreement in sensory weighting; performance. On a trial, participants struck a virtual object with a target constant velocity and received feedback on correctness. When the performance criterion was reached, feedback was eliminated, the auditory and/or haptic hardness of the struck object were changed, and the effects on subsequent striking velocity and performance were measured. In unimodal trials only the haptic or auditory display was presented. In multisensory trials, the audio-haptic changes could be congruent (e.g., both increased in hardness) or incongruent. We recruited participants with different levels of expertise with the task: percussionists, nonpercussionist musicians and nonmusicians. For both modalities, striking velocity increased with decreasing hardness, and vice versa. With the vast majority of participants, changes in haptic hardness were perceptually more relevant because they influ- enced striking velocity to a greater degree than changes in auditory hardness. The perceptual weighting of auditory information was robust to context variations (unimodal vs. multimodal), independent of exper- tise, uniform across participants and modulated by audio-haptic congruence. The perceptual weighting of haptic information was modulated by context and expertise, more varied across participants and robust to changes in audio-haptic congruence. Performance in tracking velocity was more strongly affected by haptic than auditory information, was not at its best in a multisensory context and was independent of information congruence.},

abstract = {Music is a rich form of nonverbal communication, in which the movements that expert musicians make during performance can influence the perception of expressive and structural features of the music. Whether the actual skill of a musician is perceivable from vision of movement was examined. In Experiment 1, musicians and non-musicians rated performances by novice, intermediate and expert clarinettists from point-light animations of their movements, sound recordings, or both. Performances by clarinettists of more advanced skill level were rated significantly higher from vision of movements, although this effect was stronger when sound was also presented. In Experiment 2, movements and sound from the novice and expert clarinettists' performances were switched for half the presentations, and were matched for the rest. Ratings of novice music were significantly higher when presented with expert movements, although the opposite was not found for expert sound presented with novice movements. No perceptual effect of raters' own level of musicianship was found in either experiment. These results suggest that expertise is perceivable from vision of musicians' body movements, although perception of skill from sound is dominant. The results from Experiment 2 further indicate a cross-modal effect of vision and audition on the perception of musical expertise.},

However, these studies do not take the possible effects of feedback latencies into account. Therefore, this research investigates the impact of tactile feedback delays on touchscreen keyboard usage. The first experiment investigated four tactile feedback delay conditions during a number entry task. The results showed that keypads with a constant delay (18 ms) and the smallest feedback delay variation were faster to use and produced less errors compared to conditions with wider delay variability. The experiment also produced an unexpected finding – users seemed to perceive buttons with longer delays as heavier, with a need for greater force when pressing. Therefore another experiment was conducted to investigate this phenomenon. Seven delay conditions were tested using a magnitude estimation method. The results indicate that using different latencies can be used to represent tactile weight in touchscreen interaction.},

abstract = {This paper presents experiments measuring psychophysical thresholds for multi-finger single point interaction with small haptic effects. Subjects used the UW Multi-Finger Haptic Display to interact with small haptic icons in a virtual environment. A forced-choice adaptive thresholding method is used to find a minimum detectable force magnitude. First, studies are performed to evaluate the consistency of our test apparatus across the four fingertips and to compare our application of the adaptive thresholding method to the prior work. Next, force detection thresholds for individual fingers are collected and compared to the force detection threshold using four fingers simultaneously. The results show comparable force detection levels between index, middle, pinkie and multi-finger interaction (33.5, 32.1, 33.5, 28.9 mN respectively) but less sensitivity with the ring finger (mean threshold of 43.6 mN). Repeated measures analysis of variance and t-tests with Bonferroni correction supports these conclusions. Most importantly, we show that the multi-finger threshold is not significantly lower than the threshold of the individual fingers. The implication for device design is that the relevant multi-finger device parameters are no more stringent than for single finger devices.},

abstract = {Separate mechanoreceptor systems in humans were isolated by varying the spectra of vibrotactile stimuli. First, the function relating threshold to frequency of a sinusoid was obtained on the fingertip for each of four subjects, and it was found to comprise two limbs: a Pacinian and a non-Pacinian limb. The peak sensitivity within the Pacinian limb (mediated by Pacinian corpuscles) was around 250 Hz and spanned the region from 65 to 400 Hz. The non-Pacinian limb showed no detectable change in sensitivity in the region between 10 and 65 Hz. These two limbs were then treated as psychophysical channels in experiments in which narrow band noise and individual sinusoids were used to excite one or both channels. In the second and third experiments, the noise stimuli varied in bandwidth from 8 to 70 Hz and varied in center frequency from 25 to 218 Hz. Masking functions were obtained for ON-frequency conditions (the sinusoidal test and noise masker occupied the same frequency region) and for OFF-frequency conditions (the test and masker occupied different frequency regions). The ON-frequency experiments were used to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the Pacinian channel at threshold. The OFF-frequency masking experiments were used to infer the shape of the Pacinian channel at frequencies below 65 Hz, where thresholds for Pacinian activation were above detection threshold. The results of these three experiments predicted the findings of a fourth masking experiment with a parameter free model that treated the Pacinian channel as a filter that integrates stimulus power. The results show that the Pacinian channel is analogous to a critical band in the auditory system.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the theory, design and construction of a haptic display for creating texture sensations through variations in surface friction. Ultrasonic frequency, low amplitude vibrations between two flat plates have been shown to create a squeeze film of air between the two plate surfaces thereby reducing the friction [1][2]. We show that a reduction of friction will also occur between a human finger and a vibrating plate. Thus, a vibrating plate can serve as a haptic interface. The amplitude of vibration can also be correlated to the amount of friction reduction between the plate and the finger. Varying the surface friction between the finger and the haptic interface is a way of indirectly controlling shear forces on the finger during active exploration. Using finger position and velocity feedback on the display allows for the creation of spatial texture sensations.},

In this work, we are interested in how the vibration sensitivity at $\omega$ 1 is changed under the condition adding the tangential vibration with $\omega$ 2 which is the frequency of tangential direction on the skin surface. Through all experiments, we found that the vibration sensitivity at $\omega$ 1 = 8, 10, and 25 Hz is improved approximately 30{\%} with the p -value of below 0.1{\%} by an adequate setting condition of $\omega$ 2 = 3 Hz.},

In this study we calculate in detail the deformation of finger tissue when a finger comes into contact with a rigid plate using a FE (finite element) model to clarify the reason for the precise location of the receptors. The FE model is constructed using measured geometry and material properties. As a result, we found that the strain energy is concentrated at the tactile receptor locations. When a frictional force is applied, the stress/strain is concentrated near the edge of the contact area. By calculating the stress/strain distribution using models with/without epidermal ridges/papillae, we found that the shape of the epidermal ridges/papillae influences the stress/strain distribution near the tactile receptors.},

The author reviews the guidelines proposed by other researchers and explains how they were concretely applied with the sponge. He concludes that no single strategy constitutes a solution to the issue of mapping and that musical compositions are complex entities that require the use of a multitude of mapping strategies in parallel. It is hoped that the mappings described combined with new strategies will eventually lead to the emergence of a musical language that is idiomatic to the sponge.},

abstract = {With real-time models of friction that take velocity as input, accuracy depends in great part on adequately estimating velocity from position measurements. This process can be sensitive to noise, especially at high sampling rates. In audio-haptic acoustic simulations, often characterized by friction-induced, relaxation-type stick-slip oscillations, this gives a gritty, dry haptic feel and a raspy, unnatural sound. Numerous techniques have been proposed, but each depend on tuning parameters so that they may offer a good trade-off between delay and noise rejection. In an effort to compare fairly, each of thirteen methods considered in the present study was automatically optimized and evaluated; finally a subset of these were compared subjectively. Results suggest that no one method is ideal for all gain levels, though the best general performance was found by using a sliding-mode differentiator as input to a Kalman integrator. An additional conclusion is that estimators do not approach the quality available in physical velocity transduction, and therefore such sensors should be considered in haptic device design.},

We then investigate the influence of spectral envelope modulation on perceived quality with a double-blind ran- domized AB comparison task. Eight participants listened to 12 pairs of sounds with vibrato matched for loudness. Each pair included one sound with constant average spectral envelope (identical amplitude modulation over all frequencies) and one with modulated spectral enve- lope (frequency dependent amplitude modulation). Participants were asked to choose which version sounded the most natural. The statistical analysis revealed a significant preference for sounds with modulated spectral envelope (p {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {1. The effect of changes in amplitude on the perceived pitch of cutaneous vibratory stimuli was studied in psychophysical experiments designed to test whether the coding of information about the frequency of the vibration might be based on the ratio of recruitment of the PC (Pacinian corpuscle-associated) and RA (rapidly adapting) classes of tactile sensory fibres. The study was based on previous data which show that at certain vibration frequencies (e.g. 150 Hz) the ratio of recruitment of the PC and RA classes should vary as a function of vibration amplitude. 2. Sinusoidal vibration at either 30 Hz or 150 Hz, and at an amplitude 10 dB above subjective detection thresholds was delivered in a 1 s train to the distal phalangeal pad of the index finger in eight human subjects. This standard vibration was followed after 0.5 s by a 1 s comparison train of vibration which (unknown to the subject) was at the same frequency as the standard but at a range of amplitudes from 2 to 50 dB above the detection threshold. A two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used in which the subject had to indicate whether the comparison stimulus was higher or lower in pitch (frequency) than the standard. 3. Marked differences were seen from subject to subject in the effect of amplitude on perceived pitch at both 30 Hz and 150 Hz. At 150 Hz, five out of the eight subjects reported an increase in pitch as the amplitude of the comparison vibration increased, one experienced no change, and only two experienced the fall in perceived pitch that is predicted if the proposed ratio code contributes to vibrotactile pitch judgements. At 30 Hz similar intersubject variability was seen in the pitch-amplitude functions. 4. The results do not support the hypothesis that a ratio code contributes to vibrotactile pitch perception. We conclude that temporal patterning of impulse activity remains the major candidate code for pitch perception, at least over a substantial part of the vibrotactile frequency bandwidth.},

abstract = {Sequential actions such as playing a piano or tapping in synchrony to an external signal put high cognitive and motor demands on producers, including the generation of precise timing at a wide variety of rates. Tactile information from the fingertips has been shown to contribute to the control of timing in finger tapping tasks. We addressed the hypothesis that reduction of timing errors is related to tactile afferent information in pianists' finger movements during performance. Twelve pianists performed melodies at four rates in a synchronization-continuation paradigm. The pianists' finger motion trajectories toward the piano keys, recorded with a motion capture system, contained different types and amounts of kinematic landmarks at different performance rates. One landmark, a finger-key (FK) landmark, can occur when the finger makes initial contact with the key surface and changes its acceleration abruptly. Overall, there were more FK landmarks in the pianists' keystrokes, as the performance rate increased. The pianists were divided into two groups: those with low percentages of FK in the medium rates that increased with increasing performance rate and those with persistently high FK percentages. Low-FK pianists showed a positive relationship between increased tactile feedback from the current keystroke and increased temporal accuracy in the upcoming keystroke. These findings suggest that sensory information available at finger-key contact enhances the timing accuracy of finger movements in piano performance.},

We proposed that the percept of a 3D bump is created when local gradients of the rendered virtual surface are mapped to lateral friction forces. To val- idate this approach, we first establish a psychophysical model that relates the perceived friction force to the con- trolled voltage applied to the tactile feedback device. We then use this model to demonstrate that participants are three times more likely to prefer gradient force profiles than other commonly used rendering profiles. Finally, we present a generalized algorithm and conclude the paper with a set of applications using our tactile rendering technology.},

abstract = {Auditory information plays an important role in fine motor control such as speech and musical performance. The purpose of this study was to assess expertise-dependent differences in the role of temporal information of auditory feedback in the production of sequential movements. Differences in motor responses to the transient delay of tone production during musical performance between expert pianists and non-musicians were evaluated. Compared to expert pianists, non-musicians showed more pronounced movement disruptions following the delayed auditory feedback. For example, in response to a perturbation the inter-keystroke interval was prolonged and the key-press was longer in non-musicians, while the expert pianist marginally shortened both measures. These distinct differences between groups suggest that extensive musical training influences feedback control in sequential finger movements. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the age at which the expert pianists commenced their musical training and the amount of disruption. Overall, these findings suggest that expert pianists have a higher level of robustness against perturbations and depend less on auditory feedback during the performance of sequential movements. ?? 2014 IBRO.},

The new interface technologies are broadly impacting music technology and culture. New musical interfaces use a variety of sensing (and actuating) modalities to receive and present information to users, and often require techniques from signal processing and machine learning in order to extract and fuse high level information from noisy, high dimensional signals over time. Hence they pose many interesting signal processing challenges while offering fascinating possibilities for new research. At the same time the richness of possibilities for new forms of musical interaction requires a new approach to the design of musical technologies and has implications for performance aesthetics and music pedagogy. This tutorial begins with a general and gentle introduction to the theory and practice of the design of new technologies for musical creation and performance.

abstract = {This thesis addresses the perceptual evaluation of violins from the player perspective. Three carefully controlled violin-playing studies were carried out, wherein experienced musicians assessed violins of different make and age, and described their choices in open-ended questionnaires. The focus was gradually narrowed from examining overall preference (Study 1) to the evaluation of certain perceptual attributes of the violin (Studies 2 and 3). Two distinct yet complementary approaches were followed: a systematic investigation into the reliability of preference judgments, and an exploratory analysis of concepts emerging from impromptu preference verbalizations.Study 1 examined both intra- and inter-player consistency in repetitive violin preference rankings. It was found that violinists are self-consistent when evaluating different instruments but a significant lack of agreement between musicians was observed. Study 2 investigated the origin of inter-individual differences and measured the extent to which different attributes of the instrument influence preference. Results showed that whereas violinists tend to agree of what particular qualities they look for in an instrument—preference was strongly associated with sound richness and, to a lesser extent, dynamic range—the perception of the same attributes widely varies across individuals. Study 3 focused on the evaluation of richness and dynamic range in constrained (playing only certain notes on certain registers) vs. unconstrained (playing a certain excerpt from the classical repertoire) tasks. The perception of richness from playing vs. listening tasks (using recorded sounds from the playing task) was also examined. Results suggested that specifying the musical material and technique removes a significant amount of inter-player variability: the more focused the task, the more self-consistent violinists are and the more they agree with each other. From verbal responses collected in the first and second studies, a categorization scheme emerged that illustrates the complex links between the different player-typical concepts (e.g., response, clarity, balance), properties (e.g., ease, richness, projection), and underlying themes (handling, sound and their relevance to the individual). A psycholinguistic analysis of the quality-relevant lexicon showed a diversity of linguistic devices borrowed mainly from four semantic fields (perceptual dimensions) related to texture-temperature (smooth vs. rough), action-presence (resonant vs. muted), size-volume (deep vs. flat) and light (dark vs. bright). Richness, associated with the perceived amount of low-to-mid harmonics in the sound, was identified as a key perceptual factor in evaluating violin quality.},

Screen objects such as windows, buttons, sliders, and pull-down menus are mapped to the workspace of a two-axis haptic interface called the Moose where they emerge as patches and lines of varying resistance. The Moose operates much like a mouse except that it is able to move under its own power and thereby make apparent touchable virtual objects. Thus presented to the hand. interface objects may be located. identified, and even manipulated or activated. Using Microsoft Windows as a test bench, we have proven the feasibility and usefulness of the haptic interface approach for non-visual computer access.

abstract = {Thresholds for the perception of vibration on the hand reduce with increasing area of excitation when the thresholds are mediated by the Pacinian channel (a phenomenon known as spatial summation) but thresholds are generally independent of the area of excitation when they are mediated by non-Pacinian channels. The effect of the area of excitation on vibrotactile thresholds at the sole of the foot has not been thoroughly investigated. In the study reported in this paper, thresholds for the perception of 20Hz vibration and 160Hz vibration were determined on the foot (at the big toe (hallux), the medial (inside) ball, the lateral (outside) ball, and the heel) and on the hand (at the thenar eminence and at the fingertip) in 12 male subjects using four probe diameters: 1mm (0.19cm2 excitation area), 3mm (0.38cm2), 6mm (0.78mm2) and 10mm (1.53cm2) with a 2mm gap between the vibrating probe and a fixed surround. On both the hand and the foot, thresholds for the perception of 160Hz vibration decreased as the probe diameter increased. There was no overall consistent change in thresholds for the perception of 20Hz vibration. Thresholds for the perception of 160Hz vibration were lowest at the fingertip and highest at the big toe. Thresholds for 20Hz vibration were also lowest at the fingertip. It is concluded that on the sole of the foot there is evidence of spatial summation in the perception of 160Hz vibration, mediated by the Pacinian channel, but not in the perception of 20Hz vibration, mediated by a non-Pacinian channel. The findings show that vibrotactile thresholds at the foot obtained with different areas of excitation, or an unknown area of excitation, should not be compared. It is concluded that there is a need to standardise methods of measuring the vibrotactile thresholds at the foot that are obtained for clinical applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 IPEM.},

This audio-haptic relationship has potential for enrich- ing interaction in human-computer interfaces. How can interface designers manipulate attention using audio-haptic media? We propose a theoretical per- ceptual framework for design of audio-haptic media, influenced by aesthetic frameworks in visual theory and audio design. The aesthetic issues of the mul- timodal interplay between audio and haptic modalities are presented, with dis- cussion based on anecdotes from multimedia artists. We use the aesthetic theory to develop four design mechanisms for transition between audio and haptic channels: synchronization, temporal linearization, masking and synchresis. An example composition using these mechanisms, and the multisensory design intent, is discussed by the designers.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method of integrating two contrasting sensor systems for studying human interaction with a mechanical system, using piano performance as the case study. Piano technique requires both precise small-scale motion of fingers on the key surfaces and planned large-scale movement of the hands and arms. Where studies of performance often focus on one of these scales in isolation, this paper investigates the relationship between them. Two sensor systems were installed on an acoustic grand piano: a monocular high-speed camera tracking the position of painted markers on the hands, and capacitive touch sensors attach to the key surfaces which measure the location of finger-key contacts. This paper highlights a method of fusing the data from these systems, including temporal and spatial alignment, segmentation into notes and automatic fingering annotation. Three case studies demonstrate the utility of the multi-sensor data: analysis of finger flexion or extension based on touch and camera marker location, timing analysis of finger-key contact preceding and following key presses, and characterisation of individual finger movements in the transitions between successive key presses. Piano performance is the focus of this paper, but the sensor method could equally apply to other fine motor control scenarios, with applications to human-computer interaction.},

Here we review behavioural and neurophysiological (M/EEG, TMS and fMRI) research exploring this topic using the brain of musicians as a model system. Our review focuses on a recent body of evidence suggesting that this form of coupling might have (at least) two cognitive functions. First, it leads to the generation of equivalent predictions (concerning both when and what event is more likely to occur) during both perception and production of music. Second, it underpins the common coding of perception and action that supports the integration of the motor output of multiple musicians' in the context of joint musical tasks. Essentially, training-based coupling of perception and action might scaffold the human ability to represent complex (structured) actions and to entrain multiple agents – via reciprocal prediction and adaptation – in the pursuit of shared goals.},

The instrument described in this study is based on a virtual control surface that player strikes with a hand held sensor-actuator device. We designed two tactile cues to augment the stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface. We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance. In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all. The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument.},

The haptic feedback is by vibrotactile stimulations only and does not require a force feedback mechanism. We conducted user experiments to show that the resultant haptic feedback is realistic and distinctive. Participants were able to distinguish among six different virtual buttons, with 94.1{\%} accuracy even in a noisy environment.

Temperature thresholds were measured on the right thenar eminence and on the distal volar aspect of the second and third fingers held together on both sides. Vibration thresholds were measured dorsally on the second and fifth metacarpal bones and on the second and fifth fingers proximal to the nail roots. Subjects with advanced neurological symptoms had higher temperature and vibration thresholds than subjects with less advanced symptoms. No such relation was found between vascular symptoms and the outcome of sensory testing. Thus neurological but not vascular symptoms are reflected by the outcome of quantitative sensory testing. In subjects with advanced neurological symptoms the tests gave a high proportion of abnormal results, indicating that these tests may be used for the diagnosis of vibration syndrome on an individual basis. Patients with advanced vascular and neurological symptoms had higher exposure dose scores than patients with less advanced symptoms, indicating a dose response relation between vibration "dose" and neurological and vascular symptoms.},

Participants (group sizes: n = 4 to 7) explored one of these texture types either by fingertip on real gratings (Finger real), by stylus on real gratings (Stylus real), or by stylus on virtual gratings (Stylus virtual). The real gratings were fabricated from stainless steel by an electrical discharge machining process while the virtual gratings were rendered via a programmable force-feedback device. All gratings had a 2.5-mm spatial period. On each trial, participants compared test gratings with 55, 60, 65, or 70 $\mu$m amplitudes against a 50-$\mu$m reference. The results indicate that discrimination thresholds did not differ significantly between sinusoidal and triangular gratings. With sinusoidal and triangular data combined, the average (mean + standard error) for the Stylus-real threshold (2.5 ± 0.2 $\mu$m) was significantly smaller (p {\textless}; 0.01) than that for the Stylus-virtual condition (4.9 ± 0.2 $\mu$m). Differences between the Finger-real threshold (3.8 ± 0.2 $\mu$m) and those from the other two conditions were not statistically significant. Further studies are needed to better understand the differences in perceptual cues resulting from interactions with real and virtual gratings.},

abstract = {In order to better understand how violinists evaluate violin quality, playing and listening tests were conducted. Three French professional violinists assessed three violins with different qualities. The assessment was conducted orally, with violinists answering open questions regarding the quality of each violin while playing it and then while listening to it played live by somebody else. The violinists were further asked to rank these violins in order of preference. The oral reports were transcribed and linguistically analysed. It first allowed us to identify the linguistic resources in French available to speakers to account for their experience, in particular to describe what appeared as two different entities: the violin and its sound. Secondly, a semantic analysis of the discourses showed that these resources were shared by the participants but were used differently to qualify each violin in the two experiments. In particular, the analysis revealed aspects, like the “ease of playing" or the “projection", which were used frequently in the playing test but very little in the listening test. This can be explained by the fact that, in the listening test, the evaluation is made by relying on the sound only and, therefore, this evaluation is mainly based on the resultant sound without any possible comparison nor control on the nature of the sound and the manner by which it was produced. However such processes of comparison and control on the instrument when producing the sound are essential for the evaluation of the quality of a violin by violinists, as proved by the agency given to the violin in the assessments given during the playing task and the players' statements regarding what is a “good" or a “bad" violin.},

We propose using human observers to determine if vibrations rendered using a given haptic device are accompanied by artifacts detectable to humans. This determination produces a performance measure that carries particular relevance to applications involving texture rendering. For cases in which a device produces detectable artifacts, we have developed a protocol that localizes deficiencies in device design and/or hardware implementation. In this paper, we present results from human vibration detection experiments carried out using three commercial haptic devices and one high performance voice coil motor. We found that all three commercial devices produced perceptible artifacts when rendering vibrations near human detection thresholds. Our protocol allowed us to pinpoint the deficiencies, however, and we were able to show that minor modifications to the haptic hardware were sufficient to make these devices well suited for rendering vibrations, and by extension, the vibratory components of textures. We generalize our findings to provide quantitative design guidelines that ensure the ability of haptic devices to proficiently render the vibratory components of textures.},

abstract = {The paper presents a multi-modal approach to tightly close the in- teraction loop between a human user and any tool in operation. Every activity of a human being generates multi-modal feedback, more or less related to the eyes (visual), the skin (sensory), the nose (olfactory) and the ears (auditive). Here we show the useful augmentation or complete creation of a nonexistent or less avail- able feedback. As an example the performance of drilling tasks, line drawing tasks, or the complex task of bowing a violin can be considered. Some new multimodal human computer interaction technologies based on sensors and embedded systems are shown and described in this paper.},

@article{Occelli2011,
abstract = {In the present review, we focus on how commonalities in the ontogenetic development of the auditory and tactile sensory systems may inform the interplay between these signals in the temporal domain. In particular, we describe the results of behavioral studies that have investigated temporal resolution (in temporal order, synchrony/asynchrony, and simultaneity judgment tasks), as well as temporal numerosity perception, and similarities in the perception of frequency across touch and hearing. The evidence reviewed here highlights features of audiotactile temporal perception that are distinctive from those seen for other pairings of sensory modalities. For instance, audiotactile interactions are characterized in certain tasks (e.g., temporal numerosity judgments) by a more balanced reciprocal influence than are other modality pairings. Moreover, relative spatial position plays a different role in the temporal order and temporal recalibration processes for audiotactile stimulus pairings than for other modality pairings. The effect exerted by both the spatial arrangement of stimuli and attention on temporal order judgments is described. Moreover, a number of audiotactile interactions occurring during sensory-motor synchronization are highlighted. We also look at the audiotactile perception of rhythm and how it may be affected by musical training. The differences emerging from this body of research highlight the need for more extensive investigation into audiotactile temporal interactions. We conclude with a brief overview of some of the key issues deserving of further research in this area.},

The effects of stimulus frequency could be accounted for by the frequency characteristics of the Pacinian (P), non-Pacinian (NP) I, and NP III channels previously determined for the thenar eminence (Bolanowski et al., J Acoust Soc Am 84: 1680-1694, 1988; Gescheider et al., Somatosens Mot Res 18: 191-201, 2001). The effect of changing stimulus duration was also essentially identical for both sites, demonstrating the same amount of temporal summation in the P channel. Although the effect of changing stimulus frequency and changing stimulus duration did not differ for the two sites, the effect of varying the size of the stimulus was significantly greater for the thenar eminence than for the fingertip. The attenuated amount of spatial summation on the fingertip was interpreted as an indication that the mechanism of spatial summation consists of the operations of both neural integration and probability summation.},

abstract = {To form a coherent percept of the environment, our brain combines information from different senses. Such multisensory integration occurs in higher association cortices; but supposedly, it also occurs in early sensory areas. Confirming the latter hypothesis, we unequivocally demonstrate supra-additive integration of touch and sound stimulation at the second stage of the auditory cortex. Using high-resolution fMRI of the macaque monkey, we quantified the integration of auditory broad-band noise and tactile stimulation of hand and foot in anaesthetized animals. Integration was found posterior to and along the lateral side of the primary auditory cortex in the caudal auditory belt. Integration was stronger for temporally coincident stimuli and obeyed the principle of inverse effectiveness: greater enhancement for less effective stimuli. These findings demonstrates that multisensory integration occurs early and close to primary sensory areas and--because it occurs in anaesthetized animals--suggests that this integration is mediated by preattentive bottom-up mechanisms.},

Here, we describe how the ability to predict the consequence of complex gestures can change the way we integrate sight and sound when relevant visual information is missing. Six drummers and six novices were asked to judge audiovisual synchrony for drumming point-light displays where the visual information was manipulated to eliminate or include the drumstick-drumhead impact point. In the condition with only the arm information novices were unable to detect asynchrony whereas drummers were able to. Additionally, in the conditions that included the impact point drummers perceived the best alignment when the sight preceded the sound, while in the arm only condition they perceived the best alignment when the sound occurred together with or preceded the sight, as it would be expected if they were predicting the beat occurrence. Taken together these findings suggest that humans can acquire, through practice, internal models of action which can be used to replace missing information when integrating multisensory signals from the environment.},

abstract = {Repeated measures designs are common in experimental psychology. Because of the correlational structure in these designs, the calculation and interpretation of confidence intervals is nontrivial. One solution was provided by Loftus and Masson (Psychonomic Bulletin {\&} Review 1:476-490, 1994). This solution, although widely adopted, has the limitation of implying same-size confidence intervals for all factor levels, and therefore does not allow for the assessment of variance homogeneity assumptions (i.e., the circularity assumption, which is crucial for the repeated measures ANOVA). This limitation and the method's perceived complexity have sometimes led scientists to use a simplified variant, based on a per-subject normalization of the data (Bakeman {\&} McArthur, Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, {\&} Computers 28:584-589, 1996; Cousineau, Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology 1:42-45, 2005; Morey, Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology 4:61-64, 2008; Morrison {\&} Weaver, Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, {\&} Computers 27:52-56, 1995). We show that this normalization method leads to biased results and is uninformative with regard to circularity. Instead, we provide a simple, intuitive generalization of the Loftus and Masson method that allows for assessment of the circularity assumption.},

A promising research area in particular are telemanipulation tasks where vibrations occurring in the remote environment are fed back through tactile displays. Two experiments concerning the perception of vibrations were conducted. The first experiment aims at determining whether vibrations are coded primarily by frequency, amplitude, or acceleration by human subjects. Results show that primarily frequency and amplitude, but not acceleration of the vibrations were perceived. In the second experiment, subjects' just noticeable difference (JND) for frequency under different conditions was examined. The resulting JND of 18{\%} for frequencies showed neither dependence on amplitude or acceleration, which were independently held constant, nor on the reference frequencies. Therefore, it is not necessary to adjust the subjective intensity for vibrations for each human operator when designing tactile displays. {\textcopyright}2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {We have developed a texture display system that modifies the perceived roughness of textured surfaces via a voice coil actuator worn on the finger. To increase the roughness sensations, the vibrotactile stimuli from the actuator simulate the skin deformations that are activated when a wavy surface is scanned. Conversely, to decrease the roughness sensations of the textured surface, a high-frequency vibrotactile stimulus offsets the activity levels of tactile mechanoreceptors. This offset suppresses the perceived roughness of the surfaces being touched, with increase in the offset correlating with increase in the feeling of smoothness of the surfaces. We conducted an experiment in which we tested the effects of these two types of vibrotactile stimulation on grating roughness specimens, with subjective responses acquired from eight participants via the magnitude estimation method. The results obtained indicate that our method selectively increases and decreases the roughness felt. The intention is for the technique to be used to develop an augmented reality device for textures.},

The stimulus sets varied along one or more of the following dimensions: intensity of vibration, frequency of vibration, and contactor area. Identification performance was measured by information transfer. One‐dimensional stimulus sets produced values in the range 1–2 bits and, for most subjects, three‐dimensional sets produced values in the range 4–5 bits. Of the three dimensions considered, performance on the intensity variable was most affected, and performance on contactor area least affected, by simultaneous variations in the other dimensions.},

Traditional bilateral force feedback or force reflection, which applies forces to a human operator's hand or arm muscles, while generally beneficial can be limited in the operator's ability to perceive small force values. Sensory substitution for force feedback was shown in this study to increase the operator's ability to perceive small forces by allowing an increase in the effective feedback gain without risking instability or impeding the operator's inputs to the system. ?? 1995.},

All samples were recorded using calibrated measurement equipment on two Yamaha Disklavier pianos, one grand and one upright model. This paper documents the sample acquisition procedure, with related calibration data. Then, for sound and vibration analysis, it is shown how physical quantities such as sound intensity and vibration acceleration can be inferred from the recorded samples. Finally, the paper describes how the samples can be used to correctly reproduce binaural sound and keyboard vibrations. The library has potential to support experimental research about the psycho-physical, cognitive and experiential effects caused by the keyboard's multimodal feedback in musicians and other users, or, outside the laboratory, to enable an immersive personal piano performance.},

Details are provided as to how these techniques should be implemented to measure absolute and difference thresholds and factors that influence subjects' responses are noted. In addition to the methods used to measure sensory thresholds, the techniques available for measuring the perception of suprathreshold stimuli are presented. These scaling methods are reviewed in the context of the various stimulus and response biases that influence how subjects respond to stimuli. The importance of understanding the factors that influence perceptual processing is highlighted throughout the review with reference to experimental studies of haptic perception.},

abstract = {The natural interaction of humans with their environment involves the harmonious coordination of the body, for which multi-modal feedback including vision, proprioception, and tactile perception is essential. Most human-machine interfaces, however, rely on the visual feedback only, and this can lead to considerable cognitive burden. Additional haptic feedback can increase the intuitiveness of the man-machine interaction. Therefore, we propose here a new device able to generate complex vibrotactile stimulation by simultaneously modulating the amplitude and frequency of vibration. Physical measurements were first performed in eight healthy subjects to assess the capability of the device to generate vibrations. The results indicated that the vibration frequency and amplitude can be independently modulated and that the device response to the full-range step-change in the amplitude/frequency commands is almost instantaneous and symmetric. In addition, psychophysical assessments were conducted in four healthy subjects using a standard psychophysical procedure (SIAM). The outcomes indicated that the proposed device can produce approximately 400 vixels (discriminable stimuli), which allow for the generation of a high diversity of vibrotactile patterns. The proposed method allows producing different kinds of stimulation patterns using motor types that are suited for specific applications, with adjustable trade-off between vibration intensity, size, and power consumption.},

abstract = {Object manipulation produces characteristic sounds and causes specific haptic sensations that facilitate the recognition of the manipulated object. To identify the neural correlates of audio-haptic binding of object features, healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they matched a target object to a sample object within and across audition and touch. By introducing a delay between the presentation of sample and target stimuli, it was possible to dissociate haptic-to-auditory and auditory-to-haptic matching. We hypothesized that only semantically coherent auditory and haptic object features activate cortical regions that host unified conceptual object representations. The left fusiform gyrus (FG) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) showed increased activation during crossmodal matching of semantically congruent but not incongruent object stimuli. In the FG, this effect was found for haptic-to-auditory and auditory-to-haptic matching, whereas the pSTS only displayed a crossmodal matching effect for congruent auditory targets. Auditory and somatosensory association cortices showed increased activity during crossmodal object matching which was, however, independent of semantic congruency. Together, the results show multisensory interactions at different hierarchical stages of auditory and haptic object processing. Object-specific crossmodal interactions culminate in the left FG, which may provide a higher order convergence zone for conceptual object knowledge.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of fatigue of the index finger on indices of force variability in discrete and rhythmic accurate force production tasks performed by the index finger and by all four fingers pressing in parallel. An increase in the variance of the force produced by the fatigued index finger was expected. We hypothesized that the other fingers would also show increased variance of their forces, which would be accompanied by co-variation among the finger forces resulting in relatively preserved accuracy of performance. The subjects performed isometric tasks including maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and accurate force production before and after a 1-min MVC fatiguing exercise by the index finger. During fatigue, there was a significant increase in the root mean square index of force variability during accurate force production by the index finger. In the four-finger tasks, the variance of the individual finger force increased for all four fingers, while the total force variance showed only a modest change. We quantified two components of variance in the space of hypothetical commands to fingers, finger modes. There was a large increase in the variance component that did not affect total force and a much smaller increase in the component that did. The results suggest an adaptive increase in force variance by nonfatigued elements as a strategy to attenuate effects of fatigue on accuracy of multi-element performance. These effects were unlikely to originate at the level of synchronization of motor units across muscle compartments but rather involved higher control levels.},

abstract = {Pianists, who attend to the integral relationship of their particular musculoskeletal characteristics to the piano technique at hand, discover an efficient path to technical advancement and, consequently, to injury prevention. Thus, a study of pianist's hand biomechanics in relation to different piano techniques is highly relevant, as hand features may influence various techniques in different ways. This study addressed relationships between pianists' hand biomechanics and the performance of a scale in thirds, as a part of an ongoing series of studies examining relationships between hand biomechanics and performance data of primary techniques. The biomechanics of hand length and width, finger length, hand span, hand and arm weights, and ulnar deviation at the wrist were compared with tempo, articulation, and dynamic voicing (tone balance between two notes of the thirds). Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive association between ulnar deviation and tempo; the other biomechanical features showed no relationships with any of the performance criteria. Qualitative cross-sectional observation of individual profiles showed that experienced pianists perform with a higher degree of synchrony in two-note descent while pianists with organ training background play with a lesser degree of synchrony. All biomechanical features were closely related among one another with one exception: wrist ulnar deviation was not associated with any other biomechanical features; rather, data suggest possible negative associations. This study underscores the importance of wrist mobility in piano skills development. Further research using a complete set of prototype piano techniques and multiple-level pianist-subjects could provide substantive biomechanical information that may be used to develop efficient pedagogy and prevention strategies for playing-related injuries as well as rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Human psychophysical detection and amplitude discrimination thresholds for 25-Hz sinusoidal vibrations were measured on the thenar eminence using two-interval forced-choice tracking, in the unadapted state and following exposure to 25-Hz adapting stimuli representing a range of amplitudes (5-25 dB SL). As expected, detection threshold was elevated 6 to 7 dB for each 10-dB increase in the adapting stimulus. In contrast, amplitude difference thresholds for 10 and 20 dB SL standard stimuli were generally lowest when the amplitude of the adapting stimulus was equal to the amplitude of the standard. The results indicate that while adaptation impairs detection of a liminal vibrotactile stimulus, it improves intensity discrimination of supraliminal stimuli that are close in amplitude to the adapting stimulus. The compatability between these results and a recently proposed model of cortical dynamics (Whitsel et al., 1989) suggests that cortical events may contribute significantly to the physiological basis of vibrotactile adaptation.},

It modulates the friction of a glass surface by using 39 kHz out-of-plane vibrations to reduce friction. To generate shear forces, the TPaD is oscillated in-plane (i.e., “shivered”) while alternating between low and high friction within each cycle. In previous research, the ShiverPaD produced shear forces using in-plane vibrations below 100 Hz. In this research, we develop a new ShiverPaD that produces force using 854 Hz vibrations, where human sensitivity to vibration is diminished. The new device is used to display a virtual toggle switch and a variety of virtual edges. A human subject study is conducted to demonstrate that users can easily trace virtual edges displayed on the surface of the ShiverPaD.},

In this paper, we are interested in how the vibrotactile sensitivity with a frequency is changed under the condition adding the tangential vibration with the other frequency which generates to the tangential direction on the skin surface. Through all of experiments, we found that the vibrotactile sensitivity at the frequency of 8, 10, and 25 Hz is enhanced approximately 30 {\%} with the p-value of below 0.1 {\%}.},

@article{BrescianiAl:AudioTactile,
abstract = {We tested whether auditory sequences of beeps can modulate the tactile perception of sequences of taps (two to four taps per sequence) delivered to the index fingertip. In the first experiment, the auditory and tactile sequences were presented simultaneously. The number of beeps delivered in the auditory sequence were either the same as, less than, or more than the number of taps of the simultaneously presented tactile sequence. Though task-irrelevant (subjects were instructed to focus on the tactile stimuli), the auditory stimuli systematically modulated subjects' tactile perception; in other words subjects' responses depended significantly on the number of delivered beeps. Such modulation only occurred when the auditory and tactile stimuli were similar enough. In the second experiment, we tested whether the automatic auditory-tactile integration depends on simultaneity or whether a bias can be evoked when the auditory and tactile sequence are presented in temporal asynchrony. Audition significantly modulated tactile perception when the stimuli were presented simultaneously but this effect gradually disappeared when a temporal asynchrony was introduced between auditory and tactile stimuli. These results show that when provided with auditory and tactile sensory signals that are likely to be generated by the same stimulus, the central nervous system (CNS) tends to automatically integrate these signals.},

abstract = {This work aims to demonstrate and explain a nearly century old electrostatic haptic effect in human fingertips, which has since gone unreported. This effect, based on the original work of Johnsen and Rahbek [1], as well as research on electrostatic chucking devices [2], is capable of producing electrostatic forces on the finger an order of magnitude greater than those previously reported in literature. It is also capable of working with DC excitation, an aspect which stands out against previous reports which utilize purely AC excitation. This work also proposes a unified force model for this effect, drawn from electrostatic chuck research, and resolves this model with those in previous reports. We briefly discuss the background and specifics of the Johnsen-Rahbek effect, and include measurements made with our own electroadhesive surface and experimental apparatus. Finally, we discuss how this model fits in with previous observations, and its implications going forward.},

abstract = {Telerobotic systems enable humans to explore and manipulate remote environments for applications such as surgery and disaster response, but few such systems provide the operator with cutaneous feedback. This article presents a novel approach to remote cutaneous interaction; our method is compatible with any fingertip tactile sensor and any mechanical tactile display device, and it does not require a position/force or skin deformation model. Instead, it directly maps the sensed stimuli to the best possible input commands for the device's motors using a data set recorded with the tactile sensor inside the device. As a proof of concept, we considered a haptic system composed of a BioTac tactile sensor, in charge of measuring contact deformations, and a custom 3-DoF cutaneous device with a flat contact platform, in charge of applying deformations to the user's fingertip. To validate the proposed approach and discover its inherent tradeoffs, we carried out two remote tactile interaction experiments. The first one evaluated the error between the tactile sensations registered by the BioTac in a remote environment and the sensations created by the cutaneous device for six representative tactile interactions and 27 variations of the display algorithm. The normalized average errors in the best condition were 3.0{\%} of the BioTac's full 12-bit scale. The second experiment evaluated human subjects' experiences for the same six remote interactions and eight algorithm variations. The average subjective rating for the best algorithm variation was 8.2 out of 10, where 10 is best.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents an interdisciplinary, systematic study of the expression of piano timbre by advanced-level pianists in the context of musical performance and prac- tice. To begin, general issues and aims are introduced, as well as differing definitions and perspectives on piano timbre from scientific and musical points of view. After the conception of piano timbre is presented as documented by pianists in pedagogical trea- tises, the perception and verbalisation of piano timbre is investigated with experimental and quantitative scientific methods. The words that pianists use to describe and talk about different timbral nuances are studied quantitatively, according to their semantic relationships, and a semantic map of common piano timbre descriptors is drawn out. In two separate studies, the perception of piano timbre by highly skilled pianists is investi- gated. Results suggest that advanced pianists can identify and label performer-controlled timbral nuances in audio recordings with consistency and agreement from production to perception. Finally, the production and gestural control of piano timbre in musical per- formance is explored using the B{\"{o}}sendorfer CEUS piano performance recording system.The PianoTouch toolbox, specifically developed inMATLABfor extracting performance features from high-resolution keyboard and pedalling data, is presented and used to study the expressive production of piano timbre through touch and gesture in CEUS-recorded performances by four pianists in five timbral nuances. Gestural spaces and portraits of the timbral nuances are obtained with differing patterns in intensity, attack, balance be- tween hands, articulation and pedalling. The data represents common strategies used for the expression of each timbral nuance in piano performance.},

abstract = {The objective of the present research was to determine how variations in the signals generated by different vibrotactile actuators are perceived and which features are judged as being distinctive. For this purpose, three different types of actuator were used to generate signals that varied in amplitude, waveform and frequency. Participants were required to judge the degree of similarity-dissimilarity between pairs of stimuli. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques were then used as an exploratory data analysis technique to create a spatial map that depicted the relations among the various vibrotactile signals. The first dimension that emerged from the MDS represented a continuum associated with transitions in the amplitudes of the signals, with a smooth sine wave pattern contrasting with the more abrupt transitions in square waves. This may be considered a smooth-rough dimension. The second dimension extracted from the data was more difficult to characterize in that each of the two clusters along this dimension involved signals of varying waveform and frequency. Further work will aim at defining the perceptual qualities of this dimension.},

Participants heard, saw, or both heard and saw recordings of a Stravinsky solo clarinet piece, performed with three distinct expressive styles: restrained, standard, and exaggerated intention. Participants used a 5-point Likert scale to rate each performance on 19 different emotional qualities. The data analysis revealed that variations in expressive intention had their greatest impact when the performances could be seen; the ratings from participants who could only hear the performances were the same across the three expressive styles. Evidence was also found for an interaction effect leading to an emergent property, intensity of positive emotion, when participants both heard and saw the musical performances. An exploratory factor analysis revealed orthogonal dimensions for positive and negative emotions, which may account for the subjective experience that many listeners report of having multi-valent or complex reactions to music, such as "bittersweet."},

abstract = {In cognitive science and philosophy, the conception of cognition has evolved rapidly in recent years. It is no longer strictly a process that happens inside the head, intervening between perception and action. Instead, cognition is considered something that subsumes both perception and action, engages the body, and even incorporates the response of objects in the environment to actions taken upon them. One speaks of cognition being embodied and extended. Cognitive processes such as problem solving might actually involve the coupled dynamics of the body and the environment, where the finding of problem solutions involves interactively driving the cou- pled dynamics toward behaviors that satisfy the task goals of an individual. Researchers in haptics have long been working with the notions of dynamical coupling between the body and environment, with interwoven definitions of perception and action, and with flexible conceptions of the proximal and distal and the physical and virtual. It is perhaps striking to suppose that the activity during which our users wield our interface devices might be considered cognition itself. We suggest in this paper that the field of haptics is uniquely positioned to draw upon and to contribute to active debates in cognitive science, and that a new interpretation of ‘interface' can be useful in launching such an endeavor.},

abstract = {Recognizing and discriminating vibrotactile stimuli is an essential function of the Pacinian corpuscle. This function has been studied at length in both a computational and an experimental setting, but the two approaches have rarely been compared, especially when the computational model has a high level of structural detail. In this paper, we explored whether the predictions of a multiscale, multiphysical computational model of the Pacinian corpuscle can predict the outcome of a corresponding psychophysical experiment. The discrimination test involved either two simple stimuli with frequency in the 160-500 Hz range, or two complex stimuli formed by combining the waveforms for a 100-Hz stimulus with a second stimulus in the 160-500 Hz range. The subjects' ability to distinguish between the simple stimuli increased as the frequency increased, a result consistent with the model predictions for the same stimuli. The model also predicted correctly that subjects would find the complex stimuli more difficult to distinguish than the simple ones and also that the discriminability of the complex stimuli would show no trend with frequency difference.},

This paper introduces a technique that locally modulates tactile friction on a surface to allow for a multitouch exploration. Using this technique, the friction modulation effect is co-located with the actuator through the use of specific non-radiating frequencies. Because waves do not propagate in the surface at these specific frequencies, the vibration amplitude is controlled locally with a simple harmonic excitation of the actuators. The existence of such frequencies is explained through a semi-analytical model of piezoelectric actuation. The ability to locally control the vibration field and to modulate the friction independently for each actuator is demonstrated experimentally on a thin glass plate.},

Although previous studies have demonstrated that visual information can have an effect on the perceived expressivity of musical performances, the investigation of audiovisual interactions has been held back by the technical difficulties associated with the generation of controlled, mismatching stimuli.With the present study, we aimed to address this issue by utilizing a novel method in order to generate controlled, balanced stimuli that comprised both matching and mismatching bimodal combinations of different expressive intentions. The aim of Experiment 1 was to investigate the relative contributions of auditory and visual kinematic cues in the perceived expressivity of piano performances, and in Experiment 2 we explored possible crossmodal interactions in the perception of auditory and visual expressivity. The results revealed that although both auditory and visual kinematic cues contribute significantly to the perception of overall expressivity, the effect of visual kinematic cues appears to be somewhat stronger. These results also provide preliminary evidence of crossmodal interactions in the perception of auditory and visual expressivity. In certain performance conditions, visual cues had an effect on the ratings of auditory expressivity, and auditory cues had a small effect on the ratings of visual expressivity.},

The wheel is interchangeable and can contain physical textures, shapes, edges, or active elements to provide different sensa- tions to the user. Because the controller is spatially tracked, these physical features can be spatially registered with the geometry of the virtual environment and rendered on-demand. We evaluated Haptic Revolver in two studies to understand how wheel speed and direction impact perceived realism. We also report qualitative feedback from users who explored three application scenarios with our controller.},

The task consisted in pressing the fingertip against a flat rigid surface which provided broadband vibration noise of varying amplitude. Three force levels were considered, ranging from light touch to hard press. Possibly due to the concurrent effect of large contact area, spectrally complex stimuli and active pressing force, the measured sensitivity thresholds are considerably lower than what is found in most of the previous literature. Moreover, significant differences in thresholds were found between the lowest and middle force level, and the highest and middle force level.},

abstract = {Based on recent discoveries of stretch and voltage activated ion channels in the receptive area of the Pacinian Corpuscle (PC), this paper describes a two-stage mechanotransduction model of its near threshold Vibrotactile (VT) sensitivity valid over 10 Hz to a few kHz. The model is based on the nonlinear and stochastic behavior of the ion channels represented as dependent charge sources loaded with membrane impedance. It simulates the neural response of the PC considering the morphological and statistical properties of the receptor potential and action potential with the help of an adaptive relaxation pulse frequency modulator. This model also simulates the plateaus and nonmonotonic saturation of spike rate characteristics. The stochastic simulation based on the addition of mechanical and neural noise describes that the VT Sensitivity Threshold (VTST) at higher frequencies is more noise dependent. Above 800 Hz even a SNR = 150 improves the neurophysiological VTST more than 3 dB$\mu$. In that frequency range, an absence of the entrainment threshold and a lower sensitivity index near the absolute threshold make the upper bound of the psychophysical VTST more dependent on the experimental protocol and physical set-up. This model can be extended to simulate the neural response of a group of PCs.},

In- stead, we imagine a low cost sleeve that can measure the movement of the upper limb and provide tactile feedback at key locations. The feedback provided by the tactors should guide the patient through a series of desired movements by allowing him or her to feel limb configuration errors at each instant in time. After discussing the relevant motion capture and actuator options, this paper describes the design and programming of our current prototype, a wearable tactile interface that uses magnetic motion tracking and shaftless eccentric mass motors. The sensors and actuators are attached to the sleeve of an athletic shirt with novel plastic caps, which also help focus the vibration on the user's skin. We connect the motors in current drive for improved performance, and we present a full parametric model for their in situ dynamic response (acceleration output given current input). 1},

This allows us to measure the full end-to- end latency of a touchscreen system exactly as it would be experienced by a user. The Hammer does not require human interaction to perform a measurement, enabling the acquisition of large datasets.

@article{Lahav2007,
abstract = {The discovery of audiovisual mirror neurons in monkeys gave rise to the hypothesis that premotor areas are inherently involved not only when observing actions but also when listening to action-related sound. However, the whole-brain functional formation underlying such "action-listening" is not fully understood. In addition, previous studies in humans have focused mostly on relatively simple and overexperienced everyday actions, such as hand clapping or door knocking. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to ask whether the human action-recognition system responds to sounds found in a more complex sequence of newly acquired actions. To address this, we chose a piece of music as a model set of acoustically presentable actions and trained non-musicians to play it by ear. We then monitored brain activity in subjects while they listened to the newly acquired piece. Although subjects listened to the music without performing any movements, activation was found bilaterally in the frontoparietal motor-related network (including Broca's area, the premotor region, the intraparietal sulcus, and the inferior parietal region), consistent with neural circuits that have been associated with action observations, and may constitute the human mirror neuron system. Presentation of the practiced notes in a different order activated the network to a much lesser degree, whereas listening to an equally familiar but motorically unknown music did not activate this network. These findings support the hypothesis of a "hearing-doing" system that is highly dependent on the individual's motor repertoire, gets established rapidly, and consists of Broca's area as its hub.},

It was found that vibrotactile thresholds were higher in subjects reporting VWF. A laboratory investigation indicated that finger temperature had a great effect on the thresholds but that this effect only occurred outside the range of temperatures found in the study of occupationally exposed persons. Laboratory research showed that vibrotactile thresholds should be expected to depend upon vibration exposure immediately prior to the test. The vibration frequency and general configuration of the vibrotactile apparatus also influenced threshold. An awareness of these factors allows guidelines for their control to be suggested.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile stimuli can facilitate hearing, both in hearing-impaired and in normally hearing people. Accordingly, the sounds of hands exploring a surface contribute to the explorer's haptic percepts. As a possible brain basis of such phenomena, functional brain imaging has identified activations specific to audiotactile interaction in secondary somatosensory cortex, auditory belt area, and posterior parietal cortex, depending on the quality and relative salience of the stimuli. We studied 13 subjects with non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to search for auditory brain areas that would be activated by touch. Vibration bursts of 200 Hz were delivered to the subjects' fingers and palm and tactile pressure pulses to their fingertips. Noise bursts served to identify auditory cortex. Vibrotactile-auditory co-activation, addressed with minimal smoothing to obtain a conservative estimate, was found in an 85-mm3 region in the posterior auditory belt area. This co-activation could be related to facilitated hearing at the behavioral level, reflecting the analysis of sound-like temporal patterns in vibration. However, even tactile pulses (without any vibration) activated parts of the posterior auditory belt area, which therefore might subserve processing of audiotactile events that arise during dynamic contact between hands and environment.},

abstract = {Mobile touch-screen devices have the capability to accept flexible touch input, and can provide a larger screen than mobile devices with physical buttons. However, many of the user interfaces found in mobile touch-screen devices require visual feedback. This raises a number of user interface challenges. For instance, visually-demanding user interfaces make it difficult for the user to interact with mobile touch-screen devices without looking at the screen—a task the user sometimes wishes to do particularly in a mobile setting. In addition, user interfaces on mobile touch-screen devices are not generally accessible to visually impaired users. Basic tactile feedback (e.g., feedback produced by a single vibration source) can be used to enhance the user experience on mobile touch-screen devices. Unfortunately, this basic tactile feedback often lacks the expressiveness for generating vibration patterns that can be used to convey specific information about the application to the user. However, the availability of richer information accessible through the tactile channel would minimize the visual demand of an application. For example, if the user can perceive which button she is touching on the screen through tactile feedback, she would not need to view the screen, and can instead focus her visual attention towards the primary task (e.g., walking). In this dissertation, I address high visual demand issues found in existing user interfaces on mobile touch-screen devices by using spatial tactile feedback. Spatial tactile feedback means tactile feedback patterns generated in different points of the user's body (the user's fingers and palm in this work). I developed tactile feedback hardware employing multiple vibration motors on the backside of a mobile touch-screen device. These multiple vibration motors can produce various spatial vibration patterns on the user's fingers and palm. I then validated the effects of spatial tactile feedback through three different applications: eyes-free interaction, a map application for visually impaired users, and collaboration support. Findings gained through the series of application-oriented investigations indicate that spatial tactile feedback is a beneficial output modality in mobile touch-screen devices, and can mitigate some visual demand issues.},

abstract = {Perception of our environment is a multisensory experience; information from different sensory systems like the auditory, visual and tactile is constantly integrated. Complex tasks that require high temporal and spatial precision of multisensory integration put strong demands on the underlying networks but it is largely unknown how task experience shapes multisensory processing. Long-term musical training is an excellent model for brain plasticity because it shapes the human brain at functional and structural levels, affecting a network of brain areas. In the present study we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how audio-tactile perception is integrated in the human brain and if musicians show enhancement of the corresponding activation compared to non-musicians. Using a paradigm that allowed the investigation of combined and separate auditory and tactile processing, we found a multisensory incongruency response, generated in frontal, cingulate and cerebellar regions, an auditory mismatch response generated mainly in the auditory cortex and a tactile mismatch response generated in frontal and cerebellar regions. The influence of musical training was seen in the audio-tactile as well as in the auditory condition, indicating enhanced higher-order processing in musicians, while the sources of the tactile MMN were not influenced by long-term musical training. Consistent with the predictive coding model, more basic, bottom-up sensory processing was relatively stable and less affected by expertise, whereas areas for top-down models of multisensory expectancies were modulated by training.},

In Experiment 1, two types of detection thresholds were estimated for the time delay of stimuli through psychophysical experiments involving 13 participants. One was a threshold for the users to notice the existence of a time delay. The other was a threshold for the users to experience changes in the perceived textures in comparison with stimuli with no time delay. The estimated thresholds were approximately 60 and 40 ms, respectively. In interviews, the participants reported that they experienced various types of subjective changes due to the time delay. In Experiment 2, the types of subjective sensations that might be altered by the time delay were investigated. The time delays were controlled based on the acceleration of the hand motions of the participants. The participants evaluated the differences in the perceived textures between the stimuli with a controlled time delay and ones with no delay. The results indicated that the participants associated the time-delayed stimuli with changes in mechanical parameters such as kinetic friction coefficient in addition to changes in the perceived roughness of the textures.},

Previous research has shown positive correlations between flow and quality of performance and suggests that flow may function as a reward signal that promotes practice. Here, piano playing was used as a flow-inducing behavior in order to analyze the relationship between subjective flow reports and psychophysiological measures. Professional classical pianists were asked to play a musical piece and then rate state flow. The performance was repeated five times in order to induce a variation in flow, keeping other factors constant, while recording the arterial pulse pressure waveform, respiration, head movements, and activity from the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major facial muscles. A significant relation was found between flow and heart period, blood pressure, heart rate variability, activity of the zygomaticus major muscle, and respiratory depth. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of emotion, attention, and expertise, and flow is proposed to be a state of effortless attention, which arises through an interaction between positive affect and high attention.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method for generating a smooth directional vibrotactile flow on a thin plate. While actuating two piezoelectric actuators spatially across the plate, temporal sweeping of the input excitation frequency from zero to the first mode of the resonance frequency can smooth the perceived directional vibrotactile flow, as compared to a vibrotactile flow generated by conventional apparent tactile movement and phantom sensation methods. In order to ascertain important factors in the excitation pattern, a user study was conducted for three factors (amplitude (constant versus modulated), frequency (constant versus swept), and ending shape (sharp versus smooth)). The results showed that frequency sweeping in addition to amplitude modulation and smooth ending were the most important factors in smoothing vibrotactile flows. Moreover, an excitation signal with a smooth ending shape was important for generating nonspiky flows at the midpoint. In this study, a vibration isolation design is also proposed in order to substantially decrease the transmission of the actuator vibration to the mockup housing. As such, it is expected that the proposed vibrotactile flow generation method and vibration isolation design may be useful in applications including generating directional information in navigation maps or for identifying callers in mobile devices.

abstract = {Vibrotactile feedback offers much potential for facilitating and accelerating how people learn sensory-motor skills that typically take hundreds of hours to learn, such as learning to play a musical instrument, skiing or swimming. However, there is little evidence of this benefit materializing outside of research lab settings. We describe the findings of an in the wild study that explored how to integrate vibrotactile feedback into a real-world teaching setting. The focus of the study was on exploring how children of different ages, learning to play the violin, can use real-time vibrotactile feedback. Many of the findings were unexpected, showing how students and their teachers appropriated the technology in creative ways. We present some ‘lessons learned' that are also applicable to other training settings, emphasizing the need to understand how vibrotactile feedback can switch between being foregrounded and backgrounded depending on the demands of the task, the teacher's role in making it work and when feedback is most relevant and useful. Finally, we discuss how vibrotactile feedback can provide a new language for talking about the skill being learned that may also play an instrumental role in enhancing learning.},

The SenseAble1.0, a vibrotactile interface, was developed to transform the auditory parameter space into one that is adequate for hapticperception by the means of eight individually controllable actuators and machine learning algorithms. Due to the process of sensory substitution, people with hearing impairments can use the vibrotactile display to “listen” to music and perceive exterior acoustic stimuli through the sense of touch. A psychophysical pilot study investigated (i) frequency discrimination and pitch direction as well as (ii) interval size recognition of the haptic modality, and (iii) adaptation effects of the somatosensory system. Live performances using the SenseAble as a vibrotactile music system illustrate to what extent musical communication between ensemble members and a hearing-impaired musician is possible. A new prototype with enhanced spatial resolution properties for perceiving vibrotactile stimuli will be introduced as well. It was designed to improve the usability of sensory substitution systems in real and virtual environments and to maximize the efficiency of co-located and telematic performances in terms of musical communication and interaction.},

Experiment 1 used a match-to-sample task, in which blindfolded subjects were directed to match objects on a particular dimension (e.g., texture). Hand movements during object exploration were reliably classified as “exploratory procedures,” each procedure defined by its invariant and typical properties. The movement profile, i.e., the distribution of exploratory procedures, was directly related to the desired object knowledge that was required for the match. Experiment 2 addressed the reasons for the specific links between exploratory procedures and knowledge goals. Hand movements were constrained, and performance on various matching tasks was assessed. The procedures were considered in terms of their necessity, sufficiency, and optimality of performance for each task. The results establish that in free exploration, a procedure is generally used to acquire information about an object property, not because it is merely sufficient, but because it is optimal or even necessary. Hand movements can serve as “windows,” through which it is possible to learn about the underlying representation of objects in memory and the processes by which such representations are derived and utilized.},

This paper investigates haptic assistance in combination with auditory feedback instead of visual feedback. A user test is carried out in which participants select fundamental frequencies from a continuous range to play brief musical melodies. Two control conditions are compared with two detent-based haptic assistance conditions. The detents gently guide the users toward locations of equal tempered fundamental frequencies. Results from the user test confirm improved accuracy brought about by the detents. It is further helpful to provide regulation of the strength of haptic assistance in real time, allowing the user to remain always in control. This concept motivated the force-sensitive detent condition, which enables the user to adjust the strength of the haptic assistance in real time by changing the downward force applied to the haptic device. The work implies that users of graphical user interfaces could similarly benefit from force-sensitive detents and more generally real-time regulation of the strength of haptic assistance.},

We recorded multichannel ERPs in a visuoauditory version of the repetition suppression paradigm to study the time course and the locus of the semantic processing of action-related sounds. Results show that the left posterior superior temporal and premotor areas are selectively modulated by action-related sounds; in contrast, the temporal pole is bilaterally modulated by non-action-related sounds. The present data, which support the hypothesis of distinctive action sound processing, may contribute to recent theories about the evolution of human language from a mirror system precursor.},

abstract = {Computational haptics is the art and science of creating systems that interact with the sense of touch. To simulate surface textures we constructed a haptic interaction system called Sandpaper, which uses a force-feedback joystick and a novel lateral-force gradient algorithm. Using this system, we created haptic simulations of mechanical systems, solid materials, real- world surface textures, non-physical materials, and some haptic representations of medical imag- ery, and a user interface prototype. We conducted a program of exploratory research on haptic perception of simulated textures. The first experiment studied whether subjects were convinced that the lateral-force gradient simula- tions felt like textured surfaces. Confidence was high for certain kinds of simulations of texture and surface features, but low for simulations of other kinds of smooth, jittery, and other non-tex- tural materials. The subjects' descriptions provided rich information about the role of force magni- tudes, feature sizes, and several other aspects of the simulations. Two more experiments were aimed at understanding the perceptual aspect of texture called roughness. We concluded that in the case of grating textures - that is, small, periodic ridges - the roughness percept can be almost entirely predicted by the maximum lateral force encountered when feeling the simulation. This could provide controlled roughness feelings in haptic simulation environments. We propose a framework for haptic models based on using both physically-based and perceptu- ally-based representations of the haptic properties of objects and situations. We also consider rep- resentative-based descriptions that refer to familiar types of objects. Perceptually-based representations may be especially useful for interaction technologies, and describing perceptual phenomena in terms of physically-based models should lead to effective and efficient ways to implement haptic simulations. The qualitative results of these studies underscore the multidimen- sional nature of haptic texture and materials perception. Improvements and extensions to the present work are discussed as well as a program of research in haptic interaction. An extensive bibliography in haptics and related fields is included.},

All recorded neurons responded to bilateral whisker stimulation, and a subpopulation also responded to visual stimulation. Neurons responding to both visual and tactile stimuli were located in dorsomedial striatum, whereas those responding only to whisker deflections were located dorsolaterally. Responses were mediated by overlapping excitation and inhibition, with excitation onset preceding that of inhibition by several milliseconds. Responses differed according to the type of neuron, with direct pathway MSNs having larger responses and longer latencies between ipsilateral and contralateral responses than indirect pathway MSNs.

Measurements of individual finger forces were performed during single- and multifinger maximal force production (maximal voluntary contraction, MVC) for two sites of force application, the middle of the distal or the middle of the proximal phalanxes. Two fatiguing exercises were used, involving force production at the distal phalanxes and at the proximal phalanxes. Fourteen subjects were tested. 3. The total force in four-finger tasks dropped by about 43 {\%} when it was produced at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise. During force production at the other site, MVC dropped by 23 {\%}. During single-finger MVC tests, force drop with fatigue was similar across all four fingers (about -25 {\%} of their corresponding MVCs). 4. Force production by one finger was accompanied by involuntary force production by other fingers (enslaving). Enslaving remained unchanged by fatigue when measured during force generation at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise, but increased during force production at the other site. 5. The total MVC of four fingers acting in parallel was smaller than the sum of the MVCs of these fingers in single-finger tasks (force deficit). The force deficit increased with fatigue. Force-sharing patterns during four-finger tasks showed only minor changes under fatigue. 6. These results indicate that the effects of fatigue were not limited to changes in the force-generating capabilities of the muscles. In particular, fatigue could lead to a reorganisation at a neural level that defines commands to individual fingers.},

abstract = {Difficulty perceiving music is often cited as one of the main problems facing hearing-impaired listeners. It has been suggested that musical enjoyment could be enhanced if sound information absent due to impairment is transmitted via other sensory modalities such as vision or touch. In this study, we test whether tactile cues can be used to segregate 2 interleaved melodies. Twelve musicians and 12 nonmusicians were asked to detect changes in a 4-note repeated melody interleaved with a random melody. In order to perform this task, the listener must be able to segregate the target melody from the random melody. Tactile cues were applied to the listener's fingers on half of the blocks. Results showed that tactile cues can significantly improve the melodic segregation ability in both musician and nonmusician groups in challenging listening conditions. Overall, the musician group performance was always better; however, the magnitude of improvement with the introduction of tactile cues was similar in both groups. This study suggests that hearing-impaired listeners could potentially benefit from a system transmitting such information via a tactile modality. Western music is often composed of multiple melodic streams that combine to produce a complex structure that gives a particular piece its unique depth and quality. In order to appreciate the interplay of melodic streams, listeners need to be able to first segregate them. Unfortunately, people with hearing loss typically experience great difficulty in doing so primarily due to an impoverishment of their perceptual cues (Oxenham, 2008). This makes music appreciation very challenging for these listeners. For hearing-impaired people whose auditory pathway is fundamentally limited, such as those who use a cochlear implant, it is important to explore sensory substitution as a possible means of enhancing stream segregation and music perception. Recent studies have shown that visual cues can aid hearing-impaired people, and more specifically cochlear im-plant listeners, in better segregating two musical streams (Innes-Brown, Marozeau, {\&} Blamey, 2011; Marozeau, Innes-Brown, Grayden, Burkitt, {\&} Blamey, 2010). We therefore hy-pothesize that tactile information can be used in a similar way. This paper describes a first study which tests the effect of tactile cues on segregation ability in normal hearing listeners as func-tion of their musical background. Segregation of a melodic stream is made possible by both bottom-up and top-down processes. Bottom-up processes are de-rived from perceptual cues such as pitch, timbre, and loudness (Bregman, 1990; Marozeau, Innes-Brown, {\&} Blamey, 2010). Top-down processes are derived from cognitive processes involving memory, expectation, musical training, and attention (Carlyon, Cusack, Foxton, {\&} Robertson, 2001). Auditory stream segregation can also be influenced by cross-modal interaction (Carlyon, Plack, Fantini, {\&} Cusack, 2003). Marozeau et al. (2010) have demon-strated that visual cues can improve the streaming ability in both musicians and nonmusicians. Carlyon et al. (2003) has also dem-onstrated both cross-modal and nonsensory influences on auditory streaming. It is not uncommon for a listener to describe the sensation of " feeling music. " Tactile information can add to temporal cues emphasizing the rhythm within a piece (Fraisse, 1981), and can generate a strong sensation of rhythm on its own (Brochard, Touzalin, Despr{\'{e}}s, {\&} Dufour, 2008). Huang, Gamble, Sarnlert-sophon, Wang, and Hsiao (2013) demonstrated that meter is perceived similarly well (70{\%}– 85{\%}) when either tactile or auditory cues are presented alone, and that in bimodal mode auditory and tactile cues are integrated to produce coherent meter percepts. It might therefore be hypothesized that tactile information can have an effect on the perception of the musical streams. Musical training is known to have a positive effect on segrega-tion ability (Strait, Kraus, Parbery-Clark, {\&} Ashley, 2010). The effect of cross-modal information on stream segregation can there-fore interact with musical training. In order to isolate and},

abstract = {Haptic stimulation can help humans learn perceptual motor skills, but the precise way in which it influences the learning process has not yet been clarified. This study investigates the role of the kinesthetic and cutaneous components of haptic feedback during the learning of a viscous curl field, taking also into account the influence of visual feedback. We present the results of an experiment in which 17 subjects were asked to make reaching movements while grasping a joystick and wearing a pair of cutaneous devices. Each device was able to provide cutaneous contact forces through a moving platform. The subjects received visual feedback about joystick's position. During the experiment, the system delivered a perturbation through (1) full haptic stimulation, (2) kinesthetic stimulation alone, (3) cutaneous stimulation alone, (4) altered visual feedback, or (5) altered visual feedback plus cutaneous stimulation. Conditions 1, 2, and 3 were also tested with the cancellation of the visual feedback of position error. Results indicate that kinesthetic stimuli played a primary role during motor adaptation to the viscous field, which is a fundamental premise to motor learning and rehabilitation. On the other hand, cutaneous stimulation alone appeared not to bring significant direct or adaptation effects, although it helped in reducing direct effects when used in addition to kinesthetic stimulation. The experimental conditions with visual cancellation of position error showed slower adaptation rates, indicating that visual feedback actively contributes to the formation of internal models. However, modest learning effects were detected when the visual information was used to render the viscous field.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile rendering is one of the most popular means for improving the user interface of a mobile device, but the availability of related perceptual data that can aid vibrotactile effect design is not currently sufficient. The present paper reports data from a series of psychophysical studies designed to fill this gap. In Experiment I, we measured the absolute detection thresholds of sinusoidal vibrotactile stimuli transmitted to the hand through a mobile phone. Stimuli were generated by a mechanical shaker system that can produce vibrations over a broad frequency and amplitude range. The detection thresholds reported here are a new addition to the literature, and can serve as a baseline for vibrotactile stimulus design. In Experiment II, we estimated the perceived intensities of mobile device vibrations for various frequencies and amplitudes using the same shaker system. We also determined a form of parametric nonlinear function based on Stevens' power law and fit the function to the measured data. This psychophysical magnitude function, which maps vibration frequency and amplitude to a resulting perceived intensity, can be used to predict the perceived intensity of a mobile device vibration from its physical parameter values. In Experiment III, we measured another set of perceived intensities using two commercial miniature vibration actuators (vibration motor and voice-coil actuator) in place of the mechanical shaker. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the utility of the psychophysical magnitude function obtained in Experiment II, as vibrotactile stimuli produced by miniature actuators may have different physical characteristics, such as vibration direction and ground condition. Comparison of the results of Experiments II and III confirmed that the psychophysical magnitude function can reliably predict changing trends in the perceived intensity of mobile device vibration. We also discuss further research issues encountered during the investigation. The results presented in this paper may be instrumental in the design of effective vibrotactile actuators and perceptually-salient rendering algorithms for mobile devices.},

To this end, we tested subjects' ability to perceptually match a reference texture containing two spatial frequency components by adjusting the frequency and amplitude of a single frequency. All textures consisted of spatially varied friction levels on a glass display screen, where friction was modulated via amplitude of ultrasonic vibrations. Resulting chosen single frequencies were systematic, and suggest subjects can identify a single frequency, or tactile pitch, falling somewhere between those of the reference texture. Subject-adjusted frequency is modeled as a function of the reference texture's frequency components and the ratio of their amplitudes.},

abstract = {When using vibrotactile thresholds to investigate neuropathy in the fingers, the indentation of a vibrating probe, and the force applied to a static surround around a vibrating probe, affect thresholds. This study was designed to investigate the effects on vibrotactile perception thresholds at the sole of the foot of probe indentation (i.e. height of a vibrating probe relative to a static surround) and the force applied to the static surround. Thresholds at 20 Hz (expected to be mediated by the NP I channel) and at 160 Hz (expected to be mediated by the Pacinian channel) were obtained at the hallux (i.e. greater toe) and the ball of the foot on 14 healthy subjects. In one condition, the height of the vibrating probe was varied to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm above a static surround with 4-N force applied to the surround. In a second condition, the force applied to the surround was varied to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 N while using a probe height of 1mm. Thresholds at 20 Hz decreased with increasing probe height from 0 to 1 mm but showed no significant variation between 2, 3, and 4mm at either the hallux or the ball of the foot. Thresholds at 160 Hz decreased with increasing probe height from 0 to 4 mm at both the hallux and the ball of the foot. Thresholds at 20 Hz obtained with 1-N surround force were higher than thresholds obtained with 2 N, but there was no significant difference with surround forces from 2 to 6 N at either the hallux or the ball of the foot. Thresholds at 160 Hz were unaffected by variations in surround force at the ball of the foot but tended to decrease with increasing force at the hallux. It is concluded that a vibrating probe flush with a static surround, and a surround force in the range 2-4 N, are appropriate when measuring vibrotactile thresholds at the hallux and the ball of the foot with a 6-mm diameter contactor and a 2-mm gap to the static surround.},

abstract = {The neural mechanisms behind active and passive touch are not yet fully understood. Using fMRI we investigated the brain correlates of these exploratory procedures using a roughness categorization task. Participants either actively explored a surface (active touch) or the surface was moved under the participant's stationary finger (passive touch). The stimuli consisted of three different grades of sandpaper which participants were required to categorize as either coarse, medium, or fine. Exploratory procedure did not affect performance although the coarse and fine surfaces were more easily categorized than the medium surface. An initial whole brain analysis revealed activation of sensory and cognitive areas, including post-central gyrus and prefrontal cortical areas, in line with areas reported in previous studies. Our main analysis revealed greater activation during active than passive touch in the contralateral primary somatosensory region but no effect of stimulus roughness. In contrast, activation in the parietal operculum (OP) was significantly affected by stimulus roughness but not by exploration procedure. Active touch also elicited greater and more distributed brain activity compared with passive touch in areas outside the somatosensory region, possibly due to the motor component of the task. Our results reveal that different cortical areas may be involved in the processing of surface exploration and surface texture, with exploration procedures affecting activations in the primary somatosensory cortex and stimulus properties affecting relatively higher cortical areas within the somatosensory system.},

abstract = {Digital musical instruments bring about problems for performance that are different in kind to those brought about by conventional acoustic instruments. In this essay, I argue that one of the most significant of these problems is the way in which conventional computer interfaces preclude embodied modes of interaction. I examine the theoretical and technological foundations of this “disconnect” between performer and instrument, and sketch an outline for the design of embodied or “enactive” digital instruments. My research builds on recent work in human-computer interaction and “soft” artificial intelligence, and is informed by the phenomenology of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, as well as the “enactive cognitive science” of Francisco Varela and others. I examine the ways in which the conventional metaphors of computer science and “hard” artificial intelligence derive from a mechanistic model of human reasoning, and I outline how this model has informed the design of interfaces that inevitably lead to disembodied actional modes. I propose an alternative model of interaction that draws on various threads from the work of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and the enactive cognitive scientists. The “enactive model of interaction” that I propose is concerned with circular chains of embodied interdependency between performer and instrument, instrumental “resistance” to human action and intentionality, and an integrative approach to the roles of sensing, acting and cognitive process in the incremental acquisition of performative skill.},

abstract = {Two experiments investigated deaf individuals' ability to discriminate between same-sex talkers based on vibrotactile stimulation alone. Nineteen participants made same/different judgments on pairs of utterances presented to the lower back through voice coils embedded in a conforming chair. Discrimination of stimuli matched for F0, duration, and perceived magnitude was successful for pairs of spoken sentences in Experiment 1 (median percent correct = 83{\%}) and pairs of vowel utterances in Experiment 2 (median percent correct = 75{\%}). Greater difference in spectral tilt between "different" pairs strongly predicted their discriminability in both experiments. The current findings support the hypothesis that discrimination of complex vibrotactile stimuli involves the cortical integration of spectral information filtered through frequency-tuned skin receptors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Ammirante et al.},

@article{Bangert2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Performing music requires fast auditory and motor processing. Regarding professional musicians, recent brain imaging studies have demonstrated that auditory stimulation produces a co-activation of motor areas, whereas silent tapping of musical phrases evokes a co-activation in auditory regions. Whether this is obtained via a specific cerebral relay station is unclear. Furthermore, the time course of plasticity has not yet been addressed. RESULTS: Changes in cortical activation patterns (DC-EEG potentials) induced by short (20 minute) and long term (5 week) piano learning were investigated during auditory and motoric tasks. Two beginner groups were trained. The 'map' group was allowed to learn the standard piano key-to-pitch map. For the 'no-map' group, random assignment of keys to tones prevented such a map. Auditory-sensorimotor EEG co-activity occurred within only 20 minutes. The effect was enhanced after 5-week training, contributing elements of both perception and action to the mental representation of the instrument. The 'map' group demonstrated significant additional activity of right anterior regions. CONCLUSION: We conclude that musical training triggers instant plasticity in the cortex, and that right-hemispheric anterior areas provide an audio-motor interface for the mental representation of the keyboard.},

abstract = {In the psychophysical literature describing the relationships between physical and psychological magnitudes, as physical intensity increases, perceived intensity often grows much faster near threshold than at higher levels. In this laboratory, however, the loudness curve for sinusoidal vibrotactile stimuli was best fit by a single-limbed function rather than by the expected two-limbed function. In the present study, we measured the growth of vibrotactile loudness of 250-Hz sinusoidal stimuli by the method of absolute magnitude estimation to explore the source of the one- versus two-limbed discrepancy. The number of times that the stimulus was presented was varied, as well as whether the stimulator contacted the skin with constant force or constant penetration. Neither of these manipulations affected the shape of the loudness function consistently. Number of repetitions influenced the shapes of the magnitude estimation functions, but only for a few individuals. Skin-contactor coupling did not affect the shapes of the functions, although the absolute level (vibrotactile loudness) was consistently greater for constant indentation.},

The piano tones were analyzed by conventional apparatus and methods and the analysis set into the synthesizer. The analysis was considered correct only when a jury of eight listeners could not tell which were real and which were synthetic tones. Various kinds of synthetic tones were presented to the jury for comparison with real tones. A number of these were judged to have better quality than the real tones. According to these tests synthesized piano-like tones were produced when the attack time was less than 0.01 sec. The decay can be as long as 20 sec for the lower notes and be less than 1 sec for the very high ones. The best quality is produced when the partials decrease in level at the rate of 2 db per 100-cps increase in the frequency of the partial. The partials below middle C must be inharmonic in frequency to be piano-like.},

abstract = {Musicians often say that they not only hear, but also " feel " music. To explore the contribution of tactile information in " feeling " musical rhythm, we investigated the degree that auditory and tactile inputs are integrated in humans performing a musical meter recognition task. Subjects discriminated between two types of sequences, 'duple' (march-like rhythms) and 'triple' (waltz-like rhythms) presented in three conditions: 1) Unimodal inputs (auditory or tactile alone), 2) Various combinations of bimodal inputs, where sequences were distributed between the auditory and tactile channels such that a single channel did not produce coherent meter percepts, and 3) Simultaneously presented bimodal inputs where the two channels contained congruent or incongruent meter cues. We first show that meter is perceived similarly well (70{\%}–85{\%}) when tactile or auditory cues are presented alone. We next show in the bimodal experiments that auditory and tactile cues are integrated to produce coherent meter percepts. Performance is high (70{\%}–90{\%}) when all of the metrically important notes are assigned to one channel and is reduced to 60{\%} when half of these notes are assigned to one channel. When the important notes are presented simultaneously to both channels, congruent cues enhance meter recognition (90{\%}). Performance drops dramatically when subjects were presented with incongruent auditory cues (10{\%}), as opposed to incongruent tactile cues (60{\%}), demonstrating that auditory input dominates Supporting Information Figure S1 Results of Experiment 2, meter recognition in duple sequences for bimodal M/N split and M/N half split tasks.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In healthy people, the vibrotactile perception threshold (VPT) at fingertips depends on a given measurement method and on individual characteristics such as age, gender and finger skin temperature. The aim of the study was to compare the VPT values in 2 groups of healthy subjects with different finger skin temperature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 56 males and 76 females, who formed pairs matched with respect to age, gender and body mass index (BMI) but differing in terms of finger skin temperature at pre-launch testing. The finger skin temperature of less than 29°C indicated the subjects with "cold hands" and that of more than 29°C, the subjects with "warm hands". The measuring system made use of P8 pallesthesiometer (EMSON-MAT, Poland) and the measurement procedure was in compliance with the ISO 13091-1:2001 standard. VPT measurements were performed for the index, middle and ring fingers of both hands at the frequencies of 4 Hz, 25 Hz, 31.5 Hz, 63 Hz, 125 Hz and 250 Hz. RESULTS: The findings of the study revealed that the mean VPTs among the subjects with "cold hands" were significantly higher than the corresponding values among the subjects with "warm hands". CONCLUSIONS: The type of individual peripheral thermoregulation should be considered when assessing the VPT and determining its reference values.},

abstract = {A series of experiments are described in which magnitude estimates of the perceived size of steel balls were made when the balls were actively rolled between the fingertip and several other body sites (thumb, thenar eminence, forearm). This movement, called scripting, involves actively moving an object by a touching surface over another surface of the body which is passively being touched. We define this active/passive activity as "intra-active touch" and the results show that the perceptual size of the balls is dependent upon the body part passively being activated. An additional series of experiments decoupled the actively generated and passively received tactile information by having subjects either perform the scripting on another individual's body site or by having the other individual roll the balls on the subject's various sites. The latter experiments showed that the passive body can contribute to the overall impression of the size of the balls, but only when the intra-active touching involved the glabrous skin of the hands. Intra-active touch between the active finger and the passively touched hairy skin of the forearm showed no effect of the touched surface on the perceived size of the balls. The results suggest that the mechanisms of intra-active touch are different when glabrous skin activates glabrous skin than when glabrous skin activates hairy skin. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Inspired by the potential of robotic teleoperation platforms, which extend the capabilities of both the human operator and the controlled robot, we have created a wearable haptic device that gives an operator bilateral control over the gripper of a remote robot. We believe this device is the first to provide kinesthetic grip force feedback along with independently controllable fingertip contact, pressure, and vibrotactile feedback, all of which are known to be of vital importance to humans when directly manipulating objects. The device is worn on the user's index finger and thumb and allows him or her to control the grip aperture of the robot using a pinching motion. Simultaneously, the operator receives kinesthetic grip force feedback from a geared DC motor and fingertip contact, pressure, and vibrotactile feedback from a pair of linear voice-coil actuators. This paper first describes the design of the device and then proposes a controller that closely links the human's hand to the sensory signals measured by kinesthetic and tactile sensors on the robot's gripper. We demonstrate initial feasibility of the device by having a user teleoperate a PR2 humanoid robot to repeatedly pick up and set down five diverse objects.},

abstract = {The Pacinian channel has been implicated in the perception of fine textures (Hollins et al., Somatosens Mot Res 18: 253-262, 2001a). In the present study, we investigate candidate codes for Pacinian-mediated roughness perception. We use a Hall effect transducer to record the vibrations elicited in the skin when a set of textured surfaces is passively presented to the index finger. The peak frequency of the vibrations is found to decrease systematically as spatial period increases. The power of the vibrations--weighted according to the spectral sensitivity of the Pacinian system--increases with spatial period for all but the coarsest surfaces. By varying the scanning velocity, we manipulate the temporal and intensive characteristics of the texture-induced vibrations and assess the effect of the manipulation on perceived roughness. We find that doubling the scanning velocity does not result in the substantial decrease in roughness predicted by a frequency theory of vibrotactile roughness perception. On the other hand, the effects of speed on roughness match those of speed on power. We propose that the roughness of a fine surface (spatial period{\textless}200 microm) is a function of the Pacinian-weighted power of the vibrations it elicits.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile stimuli are defined in terms of their amplitude, frequency, waveform and temporal profile all of which have been varied to create tactons. A number of approaches have been adopted to design tactons including multidimensional scaling, iterative empirical methods and using perceptual processing models. The objective of the present set of experiments was to create sets of tactons based on the properties of the dimensions of vibrotactile stimuli. An absolute identification paradigm was used in which each of nine tactons was presented eight times using a tactor mounted on either the index finger or forearm. It was found that tactons created by varying the frequency, amplitude and temporal profile of the vibrotactile stimuli were correctly identified on 73-83 percent of the trials, with a mean information transfer of 2.41 bits. The latter metric indicates that for these sets of nine tactons between five and six could be reliably identified. The vibrotactile stimuli delivered in the experiments were identified as consistently on the forearm as the hand and the IT values were similar at the two locations. This suggests that sites other than the hand can be used effectively in tactile communication systems and that it is channel capacity that ultimately determines performance on this type of task.},

abstract = {Our brain is known to automatically optimize effort expenditure during motor coordination, such that for example, during bimanual braking of a bicycle, a well-oiled brake will automatically be used more than a corroded, heavy brake. But how does our brain infer the effort expenditure? All previous motor coordination models have believed that the effort in a task is known precisely to our brain, solely from the motor commands it generates. Here we show that this belief is incorrect. Through experiments and simulation we exhibit that in addition to the motor commands, the returning haptic signals play a crucial role in the inference of the effort during a force sharing task. Our results thus elucidate a previously unknown sensory-motor association that has major ramifications for our understanding of motor coordination and provides new insights into how sensory modifications due to ergonomics, stroke and disease can affect motor coordination in humans.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamic, distributed pressure response of the human fingerpad in vivo when it first makes contact with an object. A flat probe was indented against the fingerpad at a 20 to 40 degree angle. Ramp-and-hold and sinusoidal displacement trajectories were applied to the fingerpad within a force range of 0-2 N. The dynamic spatial distribution of the pressure response was measured using a tactile array sensor. Both the local pressure variation and the total force exhibited nonlinear stiffness (exponential with displacement) and significant temporal relaxation. The shape of the contact pressure distribution could plausibly be described by an inverted paraboloid. A model based on the contact of a rigid plane (the object) and a linear viscoelastic sphere (the fingerpad), modified to include a nonlinear modulus of elasticity, can account for the principal features of the distributed pressure response.},

@article{Vatakis2007,
abstract = {We investigated the consequences of monitoring an asynchronous audiovisual speech stream on the temporal perception of simultaneously presented vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) audiovisual speech video clips. Participants made temporal order judgments (TOJs) regarding whether the speech-sound or the visual-speech gesture occurred first, for video clips presented at various different stimulus onset asynchronies. Throughout the experiment, half of the participants also monitored a continuous stream of words presented audiovisually, superimposed over the VCV video clips. The continuous (adapting) speech stream could either be presented in synchrony, or else with the auditory stream lagging by 300 ms. A significant shift (13 ms in the direction of the adapting stimulus in the point of subjective simultaneity) was observed in the TOJ task when participants monitored the asynchronous speech stream. This result suggests that the consequences of adapting to asynchronous speech extends beyond the case of simple audiovisual stimuli (as has recently been demonstrated by Navarra et al. in Cogn Brain Res 25:499-507, 2005) and can even affect the perception of more complex speech stimuli.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the results of an experiment involving a wearable sensorimotor enhancer intended to improve tactile sensitivity in human fingertips. As briefly exposing tactile receptors to subsensory vibration is known to enhance tactile sensitivity thanks to a phenomenon called stochastic resonance in the somatosensory system, applying white-noise vibration to a fingertip is expected to improve the sense of touch and associated motor skills. Against such a background, a prototype of a wearable device called a sensorimotor enhancer is proposed here. The device is attached to the radial side of the fingertip and stimulates tactile receptors by applying vibration from a lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric stack actuator. This design keeps the palmar region free, thereby helping to maintain the wearer's manipulative ability. Sensory and motor tests involving 11 human subjects were conducted to determine the efficacy of the device, and the results confirmed its usefulness.},

@article{Kolarik2016,
abstract = {Auditory distance perception plays a major role in spatial awareness, enabling location of objects and avoidance of obstacles in the environment. However, it remains under-researched relative to studies of the directional aspect of sound localization. This review focuses on the following four aspects of auditory distance perception: cue processing, development, consequences of visual and auditory loss, and neurological bases. The several auditory distance cues vary in their effective ranges in peripersonal and extrapersonal space. The primary cues are sound level, reverberation, and frequency. Nonperceptual factors, including the importance of the auditory event to the listener, also can affect perceived distance. Basic internal representations of auditory distance emerge at approximately 6 months of age in humans. Although visual information plays an important role in calibrating auditory space, sensorimotor contingencies can be used for calibration when vision is unavailable. Blind individuals often manifest supranormal abilities to judge relative distance but show a deficit in absolute distance judgments. Following hearing loss, the use of auditory level as a distance cue remains robust, while the reverberation cue becomes less effective. Previous studies have not found evidence that hearing-aid processing affects perceived auditory distance. Studies investigating the brain areas involved in processing different acoustic distance cues are described. Finally, suggestions are given for further research on auditory distance perception, including broader investigation of how background noise and multiple sound sources affect perceived auditory distance for those with sensory loss.},

Spatial summation was computed as the difference between the energies required for threshold for the two vibrators presented successively and simultaneously. Both probability summation, 0.52 dB lowering in threshold, and spatial summation, 1.94 dB lowering in threshold, remained constant as a function of the distance between the two vibrators on the thigh. Similaramounts of summation were obtained unilaterally and bilaterally on the fingers. When the frequency of vibration was lowered to 9 Hz, no spatialsummation wasfound. When the frequencies ofvibration at the two test sites were different, 160 Hz at one locus, 360 Hz at the other locus, there was no spatialsummation.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for creating virtual textures without force feedback by using a simple motion sensor and a single vibrotactile actuator. It is based on wavetable synthesis driven by the user's hand movements. The output of the synthesis is rendered with the tactile actuator attached in a hand-held box together with the motion sensor. The method provides a solution for creating tangible properties for virtual objects which can be explored by pointing at them with the sensor-actuator device. The study introduces 12 virtual textures which were based on three different envelope ridge lengths, two spatial densities, and were either regularly or irregularly organized. To evaluate the role of each design parameter in the perception of the texture, a series of experiments was conducted. The perceived similarity was assessed in a pairwise comparison test and the outcome was analyzed by using multidimensional scaling. The analysis revealed that envelope ridge length and spatial density were distinguishable design parameters while regularity was not. The textures were also rated according to five attribute scales previously determined in the pilot experiment. The results show that ridge length and spatial density influence perceived roughness and flatness similarly as with real textures},

abstract = {Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs) .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging. One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.},

abstract = {In fingertip interaction with a virtual surface, the illusion of a protruding bump can be created even in the absence of out-of-plane forces or motions, by presenting just the lateral forces associated with sliding over a bump [19]. We found that when a virtual bump on one side of a planar haptic display surface is explored with a fingertip, adding contact with the opposing side of that surface as well (pinch grip) decreases the virtual bump's perceived height. Using two motor-driven sliding contact surfaces (one for either side of the display plane), we determined when a bump traversed with the index finger alone subjectively matched a comparison bump explored with simultaneous thumb contact on the opposing side (the point of subjective equality, or PSE). The decrease in perceived bump height due to opposing surface contact was on the order of 10{\%}.},

Poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)], known as relaxor ferroelectric polymer, was used for the vibrator material since it produces large strain and quick response under applied electric fields and has excellent optical transparency. When a human fingertip touches the touch screen and produces a contact between the ferroelectric polymer and bottom electrode, electric field is localized near the contact area and the vibration of the ferroelectric polymer film is amplified by the fretting vibration phenomenon. Therefore, the film vibrator can produce localized acoustic waves enough to cause a haptic sensation on the human fingertip.},

abstract = {Haptic (touch) perception normally entails an active exploration of object surfaces over time. This is called active touch. When exploring the shape of an object, we experience both geometrical and force cues. For example, when sliding a finger across a surface with a rigid bump on it, the finger moves over the bump while being opposed by a force whose direction and magnitude are related to the slope of the bump. The steeper the bump, the stronger the resistance. Geometrical and force cues are correlated, but it has been commonly assumed that shape perception relies on object geometry alone. Here we show that regardless of surface geometry, subjects identified and located shape features on the basis of force cues or their correlates. Using paradoxical stimuli, for example combining the force cues of a bump with the geometry of a hole, we found that subjects perceived a bump. Conversely, when combining the force cues of a hole with the geometry of a bump, subjects typically perceived a hole.},

abstract = {Current development in multimodal interfaces allows us to interact with digitally represented objects. Sadly, these representations are often poor due to technical limitations in representing some of the sensorial properties. Here we explore the possibility of overcoming these limitations by exploiting multisensory integration processes and propose a sound-based interaction technique to alter the perceived materiality of a surface being touched and to shape users' touch behavior. The latter can be seen both as a cue of, and as a means to reinforce, the altered perception. We designed a prototype that dynamically alters the texture-related sound feedback based on touch behavior, as in natural surface touch interactions. A user study showed that the frequency of the sound feedback alters texture perception (coldness and material type) and touch behavior (velocity and pressure). We conclude by discussing lessons learnt from this work in terms of HCI applications and questions opened},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the addition of binary vibrotactile stimulation to continuous auditory feedback (vowel synthesis) for human-machine-interface (HMI) control. Sixteen healthy participants controlled facial surface electromyography to achieve two-dimensional (2D) targets (vowels). Eight participants used only real-time auditory feedback to locate targets whereas the other eight participants were additionally alerted to having achieved targets with confirmatory vibrotactile stimulation at the index finger. All participants trained using their assigned feedback modality (auditory alone or combined auditory and vibrotactile) over three sessions on three days and completed a fourth session on the third day using novel targets to assess generalization. Analyses of variance performed on the 1) percentage of targets reached and 2) percentage of trial time at the target revealed a main effect for feedback modality: participants using combined auditory and vibrotactile feedback performed significantly better than those using auditory feedback alone. No effect was found for session or the interaction of feedback modality and session, indicating a successful generalization to novel targets but lack of improvement over training sessions. Future research is necessary to determine the cognitive cost associated with combined auditory and vibrotactile feedback during HMI control.},

At each trial, which consisted in playing loud and long A notes across the whole keyboard, vibrations were either present or absent through setting the Disklavier pianos to normal or quiet mode. Sound feedback was always pro- vided by a MIDI controlled piano synthesizer via isolating ear/headphones, which masked the acoustic sound in nor- mal mode. In partial disagreement with the existing liter- ature, our results suggest that significant vibrotactile cues are produced in the lower range of the piano keyboard, with perceptual cut-off around the middle octave.

The object of the present study was to estimate the significance of auditory and kinesthetic feedback to pitch control in 28 students beginning a professional solo singing education. The singers sang an ascending and descending triad pattern covering their entire pitch range with and without masking noise in legato and staccato and in a slow and a fast tempo. F0 was measured by means of a computer program. The interval sizes between adjacent tones were determined and their departures from equally tempered tuning were calculated. The deviations from this tuning were used as a measure of the accuracy of intonation. Statistical analysis showed a significant effect of masking that amounted to a mean impairment of pitch accuracy by 14 cent across all subjects. Furthermore, significant effects were found of tempo as well as of the staccato/legato conditions. The results indicate that auditory feedback contributes significantly to singers' control of pitch.},

abstract = {The ability of subjects to detect temporal gaps between bursts of sinusoids or bursts of bandlimited noise was measured to evaluate the phenomenon of tactile ‘‘sensory persistence'' in older persons. Vibratory stimuli were delivered to the right thenar eminence of 27 subjects ranging in age from 8–75 years. The subjects' task was to detect the presence of a silent interval or ‘‘gap'' between flanking 350‐ms vibrotactile stimuli. The gap‐detection threshold, expressed as the amplitude of vibration relative to the absolute detection threshold, decreased as the gap duration increased and was higher for gaps in noise than for gaps in sinusoids. The threshold for detecting short gaps increased with age for noise stimuli, but not for sinusoidal stimuli. Furthermore, the gap‐detection threshold recovered more rapidly in older subjects for noise stimuli, but less rapidly in older subjects for sinusoidal stimuli. Because of these differences, it appears that the effects of age on gap detection cannot be due to a simple increase in sensory persistence, but may be due to multiple processes.},

abstract = {One of the requirements for being a successful musical conductor is to be able to locate sounds instantaneously in time and space. Because this requires the integration of auditory and visual information, the purpose of this study was to examine multisensory processing in conductors and a matched set of control subjects. Subjects participated in a series of behavioral tasks, includ- ing pitch discrimination, temporal-order judgment (TOJ), and target localiza- tion. Additionally, fMRI scans were done on a subset of subjects who performed a multisensory TOJ task. Analyses of behavioral data indicate that, in the auditory realm, conductors were more accurate in both pitch discrimi- nation and TOJs as well as in locating targets in space. Furthermore, these same subjects also demonstrated a benefit from the combination of auditory and visual information that was not observed in control subjects when locating visual targets. Finally, neural substrates in BA 37, 39/40 were identified as potential areas underlying the conductors' superior multisensory TOJs. Data collection and analyses are ongoing and will lead to an improved understand- ing of multisensory integration in a complex, musical behavior.},

abstract = {In most manipulations, we use our fingertips to apply time-varying forces to the target object in controlled directions. Here we used microneurography to assess how single tactile afferents encode the direction of fingertip forces at magnitudes, rates, and directions comparable to those arising in everyday manipulations. Using a flat stimulus surface, we applied forces to a standard site on the fingertip while recording impulse activity in 196 tactile afferents with receptive fields distributed over the entire terminal phalanx. Forces were applied in one of five directions: normal force and forces at a 20° angle from the normal in the radial, distal, ulnar, or proximal directions. Nearly all afferents responded, and the responses in most slowly adapting (SA)-I, SA-II, and fast adapting (FA)-I afferents were broadly tuned to a preferred direction of force. Among afferents of each type, the preferred directions were distributed in all angular directions with reference to the stimulation site, but not uniformly. The SA-I population was biased for tangential force components in the distal direction, the SA-II population was biased in the proximal direction, and the FA-I population was biased in the proximal and radial directions. Anisotropic mechanical properties of the fingertip and the spatial relationship between the receptive field center of the afferent and the stimulus site appeared to influence the preferred direction in a manner dependent on afferent type. We conclude that tactile afferents from the whole terminal phalanx potentially contribute to the encoding of direction of fingertip forces similar to those that occur when subjects manipulate objects under natural conditions.},

abstract = {The modality of touch encompasses distinct cutaneous, kinesthetic and haptic systems that are distinguished on the basis of the underlying neural inputs. The cutaneous receptors are embedded in the skin; the kinesthetic receptors lie in muscles, tendons, and joints; and the haptic system uses combined inputs from both. Topics in this chapter range from sensory phenomena, such as threshold-level responses, to cognitive and memory processes associated with the haptic system. Haptic perception extracts properties of objects and surfaces that lead to recognition of objects. Material properties are highly accessible, relative to geometric properties, providing a contrast between haptics and vision. The haptic system provides a map of space within reach of the body that provides the basis for recognition of two-dimensional patterns and outline drawings. The spatial map is subject to systematic distortion, particularly as a result of the movements used in exploration. Interactions between haptic and visual perception are described with respect to attention, representation, and memory. As do other modalities, the sense of touch gives rise to implicit and explicit forms of memory. The chapter concludes with applications of research on touch, including aids for the blind and deaf and virtual environments that provide haptic feedback.},

abstract = {We report three experiments designed to investigate the nature of any crossmodal links between audition and touch in sustained endogenous covert spatial attention, using the orthogonal spatial cuing paradigm. Participants discriminated the elevation (up vs. down) of auditory and tactile targets presented to either the left or the right of fixation. In Experiment 1, targets were expected on a particular side in just one modality; the results demonstrated that the participants could spatially shift their attention independently in both audition and touch. Experiment 2 demonstrated that when the participants were informed that targets were more likely to be on one side for both modalities, elevation judgments were faster on that side in both audition and touch. The participants were also able to �split� their auditory and tactile attention, albeit at some cost, when targets in the two modalities were expected on opposite sides. Similar results were also reported in Experiment 3 when participants adopted a crossed-hands posture, thus revealing that crossmodal links in audiotactile attention operate on a representation of space that is updated following posture change. These results are discussed in relation to previous findings regarding crossmodal links in audiovisual and visuotactile covert spatial attentional orienting.},

Users hear the piano music and feel the vibrations indicating which finger is used to play the note. We investigate the system's potential for passive learning, i.e. learning piano playing automatically while engaged in everyday activities. In a preliminary study, four subjects learned two songs initially and then wore the PianoTouch glove for 30 minutes while listening to the songs repeated. One of the songs included tactile sensations and the other did not. The study found that after 30 minutes, the PianoTouch subjects were able to play the song accompanied by tactile sensations better than the non-tactile song. These results suggest the value of a more detailed study.},

However, only recently, haptic systems have started to be designed with wearability in mind. The wearability of haptic systems enables novel forms of communication, cooperation, and integration between humans and machines. Wearable haptic interfaces are capable of communicating with the human wearers during their interaction with the environment they share, in a natural and yet private way. This paper presents a taxonomy and review of wearable haptic systems for the fingertip and the hand, focusing on those systems directly addressing wearability challenges. The paper also discusses the main technological and design challenges for the development of wearable haptic interfaces, and it reports on the future perspectives of the field. Finally, the paper includes two tables summarizing the characteristics and features of the most representative wearable haptic systems for the fingertip and the hand.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of sensory integration for perceiving musical performance, a complex natural behavior. Thirty musically trained participants saw, heard, or both saw and heard, performances by two clarinetists. All participants used a sliding potentiometer to make continuous judgments of tension (a measure correlated with emotional response) and continuous judgments of phrasing (a measure correlated with perceived musical structure) as performances were presented. The data analysis sought to reveal relations between the sensory modalities (vision and audition) and to quantify the effect of seeing the performances on participants' overall subjective experience of the music. In addition to traditional statistics, functional data analysis techniques were employed to analyze time-varying aspects of the data. The auditory and visual channels were found to convey similar experiences of phrasing but different experiences of tension through much of the performances. We found that visual information served both to augment and to reduce the experience of tension at different points in the musical piece (as revealed by functional linear modeling and functional significance testing). In addition, the musicians' movements served to extend the sense of phrasing, to cue the beginning of new phrases, to indicate musical interpretation, and to anticipate changes in emotional content. Evidence for an interaction effect suggests that there may exist an emergent quality when musical performances are both seen and heard. The investigation augments knowledge of human communicative processes spanning language and music, and involving multiple modalities of emotion and information transfer.},

In computer music, electronic devices are not able to replicate this feedback, creating a gap in sensory experience. This gap has the tendency to create insecurity with performers about their actions regarding the computer functionality.

Here, we provide evidence that the neural substrates for audition and somatosensation are anatomically linked. Using diffusion tensor imaging with both deterministic and probabilistic tractography to measure white matter connectivity, we show that there are extensive ipsilateral connections between the primary auditory cortex and the primary and secondary somatosensory regions in the human cerebral cortex. We further show that these cross-modal connections are exaggerated between the auditory and secondary somatosensory cortex in the lesioned hemisphere of a patient (SR) with acquired auditory-tactile synesthesia, in whom sounds alone produce bodily sensations. These results provide an anatomical basis for multisensory interactions between audition and somatosensation and suggest that cross-talk between these regions may explain why some sounds, such as nails screeching down a chalkboard or an audible mosquito, can induce feelings of touch, especially on the contralesional body surface of patient SR.},

Working Groups were formed, and a 2-step DMI design process was applied, including 2 performance stages. The evaluation tools assessed both System and Performance as- pects of each project, according to Listeners' impressions after each performance. Listeners' previous music knowl- edge was also considered. Through this methodology, stu- dents with different backgrounds were able to effectively engage in the NIME design processes, developing working DMI prototypes according to the demanded requirements; the assessment tools proved to be consistent for evaluating NIMEs systems and performances, and the fact of inform- ing the design processes with the outcome of the evaluation, showed a traceable progress in the students outcomes.},

abstract = {ASYNCHRONY BETWEEN TACTILE AND AUDITORY feedback (action-sound latency) when playing a musical instrument is widely recognized as disruptive to musical performance. In this paper we present a study that assesses the effects of delayed auditory feedback on the timing accuracy and judgments of instrument quality for two groups of participants: professional percussio-nists and non-percussionist amateur musicians. The amounts of delay tested in this study are relatively small in comparison to similar studies of auditory delays in a musical context (0 ms, 10 ms, 10 ms + 3 ms, 20 ms). We found that both groups rated the zero latency condition as higher quality for a series of quality measures in comparison to 10 ms + 3 ms and 20 ms latency, but did not show a significant difference in rating between 10 ms latency and zero latency. Professional percussio-nists were more aware of the latency conditions and showed less variation of timing under the latency conditions , although this ability decreased as the temporal demands of the task increased. We compare our findings from each group and discuss them in relation to latency in interactive digital systems more generally and experimentally similar work on sensorimotor control and rhythmic performance.},

abstract = {The development and evaluation of haptic rendering algorithms presents two unique challenges. Firstly, the haptic information channel is fundamentally bidirectional, so the output of a haptic environment is fundamentally dependent on user input, which is difficult to reliably reproduce. Additionally, it is difficult to compare haptic results to real-world, “gold standard” results, since such a comparison requires applying identical inputs to real and virtual objects and measuring the resulting forces, which requires hardware that is not widely available. We have addressed these challenges by building and releasing several sets of position and force information, collected by physically scanning a set of real-world objects, along with virtual models of those objects. We demonstrate novel applications of this data set for the development, debugging, optimization, evaluation, and comparison of haptic rendering algorithms.},

To closely examine the role of haptics in Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design an experiment was formulated to measure the users' perception of device usability across four separate feedback stages: fully haptic (force and tactile combined), constant force only, vibrotactile only, and no feedback. The study was piloted over extended periods with the intention of exploring the application and integration of DMIs in real-world musical contexts. Applying a music orientated analysis of this type enabled the investigative process to not only take place over a comprehensive period, but allowed for the exploration of DMI integration in everyday compositional and explorative practices. As with any investigation that involves creativity, it was important that the participants did not feel rushed or restricted. That is, they were given sufficient time to explore and assess the different feedback types without constraint. This provided an accurate and representational set of qualitative data for validating the participants' experience with the different feedback types they were presented with.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study of finger-based text entry for mobile devices with touchscreens. Many devices are now coming to market that have no physical keyboards (the Apple iPhone being a very popular example). Touchscreen keyboards lack any tactile feedback and this may cause problems for entering text and phone numbers. We ran an experiment to compare devices with a physical keyboard, a standard touchscreen and a touchscreen with tactile feedback added. We tested this in both static and mobile environments. The results showed that the addition of tactile feedback to the touchscreen significantly improved fingerbased text entry, bringing it close to the performance of a real physical keyboard. A second experiment showed that higher specification tactile actuators could improve performance even further. The results suggest that manufacturers should use tactile feedback in their touchscreen devices to regain some of the feeling lost when interacting on a touchscreen with a finger.

abstract = {Vibrotactile thresholds at the fingertips are affected by a number of individual, environmental, and testing factors. In the current study, we theoretically analyzed the effects of the contact orientation of the probe on the fingertip and the static pre-indentation on the dynamic deformation of the soft tissues of the fingertip in the vibrotactile tests using a nonlinear finite element model. The fingertip considered in the 3D finite element model is the distal phalanx, the portion from the distal end to the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint articulation. The fingertip is contacted by the probe at four different contact locations, which are regulated by contact angles (15{\{}ring operator{\}}, 30{\{}ring operator{\}}, 45{\{}ring operator{\}}, and 60{\{}ring operator{\}}), and three different pre-indentations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mm). The model predictions indicated that the average spatial summation of the vibration displacement (SVD) at the fingertip depends on the static pre-indentation and the probe/indentor contact orientation; although the resonance characteristics of the fingertip are not affected by either the pre-indentation or the contact location. The location-dependence of the vibration exposure factors at the fingertip was found to increase with increasing static pre-indentation. At a static indentation of 1.5 mm, the test condition specified in the ISO-13091-1 standard, the values of the SVDs determined at different probe/fingertip contact orientations differ as much as 125{\%}. Since the dynamic displacements of the soft tissues are believed to affect the vibrotactile threshold, the current results suggest that the contact orientation of the probe on the fingertip should be strictly defined and restricted to obtain reliable results in the vibrotactile perception threshold tests. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of fatigue, induced by a 60-s maximal isometric force production with the index finger, on multi-finger coordination and force production by the other fingers of the hand. Finger forces were measured during single- and multi-finger maximal voluntary force production (MVC) at two sites, the middle of the distal or the middle of the proximal phalanges. Two fatiguing exercises involving force production by the index finger were used, one at the distal phalanx and the other at the proximal phalanx. The MVC of the index finger dropped by about 33{\%} when it was produced at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise. In addition, large transfer effects of fatigue were observed across sites of force application and across fingers. Force deficit increased under fatigue, especially due to a drop in the recruitment of the index finger. Under fatigue, the index finger was less enslaved during force production by other fingers. During multi-finger tasks, the percentage of total force produced by the index finger was significantly reduced after the fatiguing exercise. The principle of minimization of secondary moments was violated under fatigue. We suggest that the most impaired (fatigued) finger shows less interaction with other fingers or, in other words, is being progressively removed from the multi-finger synergy. Some of the observed changes in finger coordination suggest effects of fatigue at a central (neural) level.},

abstract = {Modulation of lower limb somatosensory information by tendon or plantar vibration produces directionally specific, vibration-induced falling reactions that depend on the tendon or the region of the sole that is vibrated. This study characterized the effects of different patterns of plantar cutaneo-muscular vibration and bilateral Achilles tendon vibration (ATV) on the postural strategies observed during quiet and perturbed stance. Twelve healthy young participants stood barefooted, with their vision blocked, on two sets of plantar vibrators placed on two AMTI force plates embedded in a moveable support surface. Two other vibrators were positioned over the Achilles tendons. Participants were randomly exposed to different patterns of plantar cutaneo-muscular and ATV. Tilts of the support surface in the toes-up (TU) and toes-down (TD) directions were given 5-8s after the beginning of vibration. Body kinematics in 3D and ground reaction forces were recorded. Bilateral ATV applied with or without rearfoot vibration (RFV) during quiet stance resulted in a whole-body backward leaning accompanied by an increase in trunk extension and hip and knee flexion. RFV alone produced a forward whole-body tilt with increased flexion in trunk, hip, and ankle. When stance was perturbed by TU tilts, the center of mass (CoM) and center of pressure (CoP) displacements were larger in the presence of RFV or ATV and associated with increased peak trunk flexion. TD tilts with or without ATV resulted in no significant difference in CoM and CoP displacements, while larger trunk extension and smaller distal angular displacements were observed during ATV. RFV altered the magnitude of the balance reactions, as observed by an increase in CoP displacements and variable response in trunk displacement. Significant interactions between ATV and RFV were obtained for the peak angular excursions for both directions of perturbations, where ATV either enhanced (for TU tilts) or attenuated (for TD tilts) the influence of RFV. Manipulating somatosensory information from the plantar cutaneo-muscular and muscle spindle Ia afferents thus results in altered and widespread postural responses, as shown by profound changes in body kinematics and CoM and CoP displacements. This suggests that the CNS uses plantar cutaneo-muscular and ankle spindle afferent inputs to build an appropriate reference of verticality that influences the control of equilibrium during quiet and perturbed stance.},

Our research builds upon a recently made distinction between position and force cues for haptic shape perception [Robles-de-la-Torre, G., Hayward, V., 2001. Force can overcome object geometry in the perception of shape through active touch, Nature 412, 445-448]: when sliding a finger across a bumpy surface, the finger follows the surface geometry (position cue). At the same time, the finger is exposed to forces related to the slope of the surface (force cue). Experiment 1 independently varied force and position cues to the curvature of 3D arches. Perceived curvature could be well described as a weighted average of the two cues. Experiment 2 found more weight of the position cue for more convex high arches and higher weight of the force cue for less convex shallow arches-probably mediated through a change in relative cue reliability. Both findings are in good agreement with the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) model for cue integration and, thus, carry this model over to the domain of active haptic perception. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This research focuses on the relative importance of fingerpad skin stretch on the perception of friction. It is hypothesized that the perceived magnitude of friction rendered by traditional force feedback can be increased through the addition of fingertip skin stretch. Perceptual data are presented from two separate tests performed on nine male subjects. The first experiment determines the perceptual thresholds for friction based on a modified Karnopp friction model where friction is rendered as purely a kinesthetic resistance via a PHANToM force feedback device. JNDs of 0.056-50.150 corresponding to static coefficients for friction of mus = 0.2-0.8 were established. The second experiment evaluates possible changes in the perceived friction magnitude due to imposing small amounts of tangential skin stretch (0.25-0.75 mm) to the fingerpad in combination with force feedback (kinesthetic resistance). Our results show that even these small amounts of skin stretch lead to a statistically significant increase in perceived friction (p {\textless} 0.01). This significant finding will enable the hapticians to more realistically and accurately render friction via a combination of kinesthetic resistance and tactile feedback.},

@article{Spence2013,
abstract = {This review addresses the question of when spatial coincidence facilitates multisensory integration in humans. According to the spatial rule (which was first formulated on the basis of neurophysiological data in anesthetized animals), multisensory integration is enhanced when stimuli in different sensory modalities are presented from the same spatial location. While the spatial rule fits with the available data from studies of overt and covert spatial attentional orienting, and from the majority of those studies in which space has been somehow relevant to the participant's task, it is inconsistent with the evidence that has emerged from the majority of multisensory studies of stimulus identification and temporal perception. Such a mixed pattern of behavioral results suggests that the spatial rule does not represent a general constraint on multisensory integration in humans. Instead, it would appear to be a much more task-dependent phenomenon than is often realized. These results, however, are broadly consistent with a distinction between the processing of "where" and "what" (or "how") information processing in the human brain.},

OurBlock-based PhysicalModel (BBPM) imposes physicality on the audio signals by transforming them to a variable pair of effort and flow. With this pair, we can define the notions of energy and impedance/admittance for object blocks, and manage their physically-based inter- action by using special elements we call nodes. We have recently ported a subset of the BBPM environment to Pure- Data (PD), where we can construct dynamic audio environ- ments akin to a scene graph. Moreover, we can connect off- the-shelf haptic controllers to the entry node of a BBPM, excite the model with one physical variable, provide haptic feedbackwith the dual variable, and concurrently synthesize audio. We will demonstrate this system with two prototypes during the HAID'08Workshop.},

Then the paper describes two sets of experiments that were performed on in-vivo fingertips in order to understand which of the models presented fits best with the real rotational friction properties of the human fingertips. Finally an extension of the god object/proxy algorithm which allows the simulation of soft finger contact, i.e. a point-contact with friction capable of supporting moments (up to a torsional friction limit) about the contact normal, is proposed. The resulting algorithm is computationally efficient, being point-based, while retaining a good level of realism.},

@article{Juravle2013,
abstract = {Tactile perception is inhibited during movement execution, a phenomenon known as tactile suppression. Here, we investigated whether the type of movement determines whether or not this form of sensory suppression occurs. Participants performed simple reaching or exploratory movements. Tactile discrimination thresholds were calculated for vibratory stimuli delivered to participants' wrists while executing the movement, and while at rest (a tactile discrimination task, TD). We also measured discrimination performance in a same vs. different task for the explored materials during the execution of the different movements (a surface discrimination task, SD). The TD and SD tasks could either be performed singly or together, both under active movement and passive conditions. Consistent with previous results, tactile thresholds measured at rest were significantly lower than those measured during both active movement and passive touch (that is, tactile suppression was observed). Moreover, SD performance was significantly better under conditions of single-tasking, active movements, as well as exploratory movements, as compared to conditions of dual-tasking, passive movements, and reaching movements, respectively. Therefore, the present results demonstrate that when active hand movements are made with the purpose of gaining information about the surface properties of different materials an enhanced perceptual performance is observed. As such, it would appear that tactile suppression occurs for irrelevant tactual features during both reaching and exploratory movements, but not for those task-relevant features that result from action execution during tactile exploration. Taken together, then, these results support a context-dependent modulation of tactile suppression during movement execution.},

abstract = {The overall goal of the research presented here is to better understand how players evaluate violins within the wider context of finding relationships between measurable vibrational properties of instruments and their perceived qualities. In this study, the reliability of skilled musicians to evaluate the qualities of a violin was examined. In a first experiment, violinists were allowed to freely play a set of different violins and were then asked to rank the instruments by preference. Results showed that players were self-consistent, but a large amount of inter-individual variability was present. A second experiment was then conducted to investigate the origin of inter-individual differences in the preference for violins and to measure the extent to which different attributes of the instrument influence preference. Again, results showed large inter-individual variations in the preference for violins, as well as in assessing various characteristics of the instruments. Despite the significant lack of agreement in preference and the variability in how different criteria are evaluated between individuals, violin players tend to agree on the relevance of sound "richness" and, to a lesser extent, "dynamic range" for determining preference.},

abstract = {Our body is made of flesh and bones. We know it, and in our daily lives all the senses constantly provide converging information about this simple, factual truth. But is this always the case? Here we report a surprising bodily illusion demonstrating that humans rapidly update their assumptions about the material qualities of their body, based on their recent multisensory perceptual experience. To induce a misperception of the material properties of the hand, we repeatedly gently hit participants' hand with a small hammer, while progressively replacing the natural sound of the hammer against the skin with the sound of a hammer hitting a piece of marble. After five minutes, the hand started feeling stiffer, heavier, harder, less sensitive, unnatural, and showed enhanced Galvanic skin response (GSR) to threatening stimuli. Notably, such a change in skin conductivity positively correlated with changes in perceived hand stiffness. Conversely, when hammer hits and impact sounds were temporally uncorrelated, participants did not spontaneously report any changes in the perceived properties of the hand, nor did they show any modulation in GSR. In two further experiments, we ruled out that mere audio-tactile synchrony is the causal factor triggering the illusion, further demonstrating the key role of material information conveyed by impact sounds in modulating the perceived material properties of the hand. This novel bodily illusion, the 'Marble-Hand Illusion', demonstrates that the perceived material of our body, surely the most stable attribute of our bodily self, can be quickly updated through multisensory integration.},

We suggest that an important measure of performance is the dynamic range of achievable impedances -- "Z-Width" -- and that an impedance is achievable if it satisfies a robustness property such as passivity. Several factors affecting Z-Width -- sample-and-hold, inherent interface dynamics, displacement sensor quantization, and velocity filtering -- are discussed. A set of experiments designed to evaluate these factors is described, and experimental results are presented. A striking result is that inherent interface damping exerts an overwhelming influence on Z-Width.},

@book{SIDBook,
abstract = {Sound is an integral part of every user experience but a neglected medium in design disciplines. Design of an artifact's sonic qualities is often limited to the shaping of functional, representational, and signaling roles of sound. The interdisciplinary field of sonic interaction design (SID) challenges these prevalent approaches by considering sound as an active medium that can enable novel sensory and social experiences through interactive technologies. This book offers an overview of the emerging SID research, discussing theories, methods, and practices, with a focus on the multisensory aspects of sonic experience. "Sonic Interaction Design" gathers contributions from scholars, artists, and designers working at the intersections of fields ranging from electronic music to cognitive science. They offer both theoretical considerations of key themes and case studies of products and systems created for such contexts as mobile music, sensorimotor learning, rehabilitation, and gaming. The goal is not only to extend the existing research and pedagogical approaches to SID but also to foster domains of practice for sound designers, architects, interaction designers, media artists, product designers, and urban planners. Taken together, the chapters provide a foundation for a still-emerging field, affording a new generation of designers a fresh perspective on interactive sound as a situated and multisensory experience.Contributors: Federico Avanzini, Gerold Baier, Stephen Barrass, Olivier Bau, Karin Bijsterveld, Roberto Bresin, Stephen Brewster, Jeremy Coopersotck, Amalia De Gotzen, Stefano Delle Monache, Cumhur Erkut, George Essl, Karmen Franinovi, Bruno L.

abstract = {Dexterous use of the hand represents a sophisticated sensorimotor function. In behaviors such as playing the piano, it can involve strong temporal and spatial constraints. The purpose of this study was to determine fundamental patterns of covariation of motion across joints and digits of the human hand. Joint motion was recorded while 5 expert pianists played 30 excerpts from musical pieces, which featured ∼50 different tone sequences and fingering. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis using an expectation-maximization algorithm revealed that joint velocities could be categorized into several patterns, which help to simplify the description of the movements of the multiple degrees of freedom of the hand. For the thumb keystroke, two distinct patterns of joint movement covariation emerged and they depended on the spatiotemporal patterns of the task. For example, the thumb-under maneuver was clearly separated into two clusters based on the direction of hand translation along the keyboard. While the pattern of the thumb joint velocities differed between these clusters, the motions at the metacarpo-phalangeal and proximal-phalangeal joints of the four fingers were more consistent. For a keystroke executed with one of the fingers, there were three distinct patterns of joint rotations, across which motion at the striking finger was fairly consistent, but motion of the other fingers was more variable. Furthermore, the amount of movement spillover of the striking finger to the adjacent fingers was small irrespective of the finger used for the keystroke. These findings describe an unparalleled amount of independent motion of the fingers.},

abstract = {Recordings from single peripheral nerve fibres made it possible to analyse the functional properties of tactile afferent units supplying the glabrous skin of the human hand and to assess directly the relation between impulse discharge and perceptive experiences. The 17,000 tactile units in this skin area of the human hand are of four different types: two fast adapting types, FA I and FA II (formerly RA and PC), and two slowly adapting types, SA I and SA II. The receptive field characteristics and the densities in the skin of the type I units (FA I and SA I) indicate that these account for the detailed spatial resolution that is of paramount importance for the motor skill and the explorative role of the hand. The relationship between the stimulus amplitude and perceived intensity during sustained skin indentations did not match the corresponding stimulus response functions of SA units suggesting non-linear transformations within the central nervous system. These transformations, in turn, appear to vary between subjects. A single impulse in a single FA I unit may be felt when originating from the most important tactile regions of the hand, indicating that the psychophysical detection may be set by the threshold of the sense organs. Moreover, no significant noise seems to be superimposed in the respective central sensory pathways.},

Our actuated immersive 3D display, called TouchMover 2.0, is capable of providing 1D movement (up to 36cm), haptic screen force feedback (up to 230N) in a single dimension perpendicular to the screen plane, and has an additional capability to render haptic texture cues via vibrotactile actuators attached to the touchscreen. We describe the details of our design and improvements. We showcase how TouchMover 2.0 allows the user to: touch and feel the 3D contour and 2D texture of a topographic map, to interact with 3D objects by pushing them on the screen with realistic force feedback and intuitively explore and feel pseudo tissue texture within volumetric data from medical imagery (e.g., MRI brain scan).},

abstract = {Many neural and vascular diseases in hands and fingers have been related to the degenerative responses of local neural and vascular systems in fingers to excessive dynamic loading. Since fingerpads serve as a coupling element between the hand and the objects, the investigation of the dynamic coupling between fingertip and subjects could provide important information for the understanding of the pathomechanics of these neural and vascular diseases. In the present study, the nonlinear and time-dependent force responses of fingertips during dynamic contact have been investigated experimentally and theoretically. Four subjects (2 male and 2 female) with an average age of 24 years participated in the study. The index fingers of right and left hands of each subject were compressed using a flat platen via a micro testing machine. A physical model was proposed to simulate the nonlinear and time-dependent force responses of fingertips during dynamic contact. Using a force relaxation test and a fast loading test at constant loading speed, the material/structural parameters underlying the proposed physical model could be identified. The predicted rate-dependent force/displacement curves and time-histories of force responses of fingertips were compared with those measured in the corresponding experiments. Our results suggest that the force responses of fingertips during the dynamic contacts are nonlinear and time-dependent. The physical model was verified to characterize the nonlinear, rate-dependent force-displacement behaviors, force relaxations, and time-histories of force responses of fingertips during dynamic contact.},

abstract = {Both timbre and dynamics of isolated piano tones are determined exclusively by the speed with which the hammer hits the strings. This physical view has been challenged by pianists who emphasize the importance of the way the keyboard is touched. This article presents empirical evidence from two perception experiments showing that touch-dependent sound components make sounds with identical hammer velocities but produced with different touch forms clearly distinguishable. The first experiment focused on finger-key sounds: musicians could identify pressed and struck touches. When the finger-key sounds were removed from the sounds, the effect vanished, suggesting that these sounds were the primary identification cue. The second experiment looked at key-keyframe sounds that occur when the key reaches key-bottom. Key-bottom impact was identified from key motion measured by a computer-controlled piano. Musicians were able to discriminate between piano tones that contain a key-bottom sound from those that do not. However, this effect might be attributable to sounds associated with the mechanical components of the piano action. In addition to the demonstrated acoustical effects of different touch forms, visual and tactile modalities may play important roles during piano performance that influence the production and perception of musical expression on the piano.},

The digital revolution has brought about a new relationship between the instru‐ ment and the corporeal performing musician, and despite the obvious benefits of the process of digitization such as the democratization of musical skills, it may have also left us handicapped in some ways. The acoustic piano, which has held a central position in Western classical music, is used as a starting point for the dis‐ cussion. The concept of sedimentation in the context of musical instruments is discussed, and three potential drawbacks of digitization are outlined: 1) digital perfection and the loss of “transcendence through flaws”; 2) separation of the in‐ terface and the sound, and performer's loss of “finding the instrument”; and 3) loss of the opportunity of creating the new by destroying the old.},

abstract = {The role of auditory and tactile modalities involved in violin playing and evaluation was investigated in an experiment employing a blind violin evaluation task under different conditions: i) normal playing conditions, ii) playing with auditory masking, and iii) playing with vibrotactile masking. Under each condition, 20 violinists evaluated five violins according to criteria related to violin playing and sound characteristics and rated their overall quality and relative preference. Results show that both auditory and vibrotactile feedback are important in the violinists' evaluations but that their relative importance depends on the violinist, the violin and the type of evaluation (different criteria ratings or preference). In this way, the overall quality ratings were found to be accurately predicted by the rating criteria, which also proved to be perceptually relevant to violinists, but were poorly correlated with the preference ratings; this suggests that the two types of ratings (overall quality vs preference) may stem from different decision-making strategies. Furthermore, the experimental design confirmed that violinists agree more on the importance of criteria in their overall evaluation than on their actual ratings for different violins. In particular, greater agreement was found on the importance of criteria related to the sound of the violin. Nevertheless, this study reveals that there are fundamental differences in the way players interpret and evaluate each criterion, which may explain why correlating physical properties with perceptual properties has been challenging so far in the field of musical acoustics.},

abstract = {It is well accepted that the effects of mechanical vibration on the finger-hand-arm system are strongly frequency-dependent: low frequency vibration can transmit from hand to arm, while high frequency vibration is absorbed in the local tissue of fingers. This assertion has not been validated directly. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the frequency- and deformation-dependent dynamic strains in the soft tissues in a fingertip that is subjected to vibration normal or tangential to the contact surface. The dynamic responses of the fingertip were analyzed using a multi-layered two-dimensional finite element model. The major anatomical substructures, i.e., skin, subcutaneous tissue, bone, and nail, are included in the model. The fingertip was found to have a major resonance around 100-125 Hz and a second resonance around 250 Hz. The resonances of the fingertip are found to be independent of the direction of exposure (in normal or shear direction). The simulations further indicated that the dynamic strains induced by the vibration at low frequencies will penetrate deeper into the tissue ({\textgreater} 3 mm) while that at high frequencies will be concentrated in the superficial skin layer ({\textless} 0.8 mm). The model predictions are consistent with the published experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 2006 IPEM.},

The objective of the present set of experiments was to characterize the properties of surface waves induced by vibrotactile stimulation and to determine if the propagation of surface waves was a factor influencing the ability to localize a point of stimulation in a tactile display. Three sites on the body were tested: the palm of the hand, the forearm, and the thigh. An accelerometer array was fabricated and used to measure the surface waves. The results indicated that there were significant differences between glabrous and hairy skin in terms of the frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the motor. Analyses of the motion of the surface waves across the skin indicated that they were markedly attenuated at 8 mm from the motor, but even at 24 mm the amplitude was still above perceptual threshold. The localization experiment indicated that subjects were much better at identifying the site of stimulation on the palm as compared to the forearm and thigh, and that the latter two sites were not significantly different.},

abstract = {In environments where products are made use of and the product noise interferes with these activities (e.g. in the car, in an air plane, or when operating a machine or an appliance) non-acoustics factors like vibration, heat, visual effects may heavily influence the judgements on product-sound quality. Auditory virtual-reality generators are potent tools for psycho-acoustic research in complex, interactive auditory scenarios. They can be extended to serve as a tool for multi-modal psychophysics by including non-auditory modalities. Such multi-modal virtual-reality generators become more and more important as tools for product-sound-quality evaluation. However, the integration of further modalities may create problems. To gain a better understanding of the integration of auditory, visual and haptic information, it is necessary to specify which criteria have to be met with respect to temporal factors, particularly synchrony. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview on this topic. 1.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of extended suprathreshold vibratory stimulation on the sensitivity of slowly adapting type 1 (SA1), rapidly adapting (RA), and Pacinian (PC) afferents. To that end, an algorithm was developed to track afferent absolute (I0) and entrainment (I1) thresholds as they change over time. We recorded afferent responses to periliminal vibratory test stimuli, which were interleaved with intense vibratory conditioning stimuli during the adaptation period of each experimental run. From these measurements, the algorithm allowed us to infer changes in the afferents' sensitivity. We investigated the stimulus parameters that affect adaptation by assessing the degree to which adaptation depends on the amplitude and frequency of the adapting stimulus. For all three afferent types, I0 and I1 increased with increasing adaptation frequency and amplitude. The degree of adaptation seems to be independent of the firing rate evoked in the afferent by the conditioning stimulus. In the analysis, we distinguished between additive adaptation (in which I0 and I1 shift equally) and multiplicative effects (in which the ratio I1/I0 remains constant). RA threshold shifts are almost perfectly additive. SA1 threshold shifts are close to additive and far from multiplicative (I1 threshold shifts are twice the I0 shifts). PC shifts are more difficult to classify. We used an integrate-and-fire model to study the possible neural mechanisms. A change in transducer gain predicts a multiplicative change in I0 and I1 and is thus ruled out as a mechanism underlying SA1 and RA adaptation. A change in the resting action potential threshold predicts equal, additive change in I0 and I1 and thus accounts well for RA adaptation. A change in the degree of refractoriness during the relative refractory period predicts an additional change in I1 such as that observed for SA1 fibers. We infer that adaptation is caused by an increase in spiking thresholds produced by ion flow through transducer channels in the receptor membrane. In a companion paper, we describe the time-course of vibratory adaptation and recovery for SA1, RA, and PC fibers.},

abstract = {We investigated the propagation patterns of cutaneous vibration in the hand during interactions with touched objects. Prior research has highlighted the importance of vibrotactile signals during haptic interactions, but little is known of how vibrations propagate throughout the hand. Furthermore, the extent to which the patterns of vibrations reflect the nature of the objects that are touched, and how they are touched, is unknown. Using an apparatus comprised of an array of accelerometers, we mapped and analyzed spatial distributions of vibrations propagating in the skin of the dorsal region of the hand during active touch, grasping, and manipulation tasks. We found these spatial patterns of vibration to vary systematically with touch interactions and determined that it is possible to use these data to decode the modes of interaction with touched objects. The observed vibration patterns evolved rapidly in time, peaking in intensity within a few milliseconds, fading within 20-30 ms, and yielding interaction-dependent distributions of energy in frequency bands that span the range of vibrotactile sensitivity. These results are consistent with findings in perception research that indicate that vibrotactile information distributed throughout the hand can transmit information regarding explored and manipulated objects. The results may further clarify the role of distributed sensory resources in the perceptual recovery of object attributes during active touch, may guide the development of approaches to robotic sensing, and could have implications for the rehabilitation of the upper extremity.},

abstract = {Thresholds for the detection of vibrotactile signals of varied duration applied to the thenar eminence were measured in the absence of and in the presence of a masking stimulus. Signals were 250‐ and 500‐Hz sinusoids and noise bursts with bandwidth limited to 250–1000 Hz. The masking stimulus was either a 250‐Hz sinusoid, which was presented in phase with the signal when it was sinusoidal, or noise. Changes in threshold as a function of changes in signal duration were found which were predicted accurately from Zwislocki's theory [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 32, 1046–1060 (1960)] of temporal summation when the signal was detected by the Pacinian channel, but not when it was detected by a non‐Pacinian channel (NP). However, when either the signal or the masking stimulus or both were noise, NP thresholds were affected by changes in signal duration. Only when the signal and masking stimuli were both sinusoids were NP thresholds independent of signal duration. It is concluded that signal duration effects in the NP channel are not due to temporal integration, but rather to increases in information about the signal content provided to the subject as exposure duration is increased.},

Through instrumental practice, the performer is able to learn and internalise sensory responses inherent in the mechanical production of sound. However, current electronic musical input devices and interfaces lack the ability to provide a satisfactory haptic feedback to the performer. The lack of feedback information from elec- tronic controllers to the performer introduces aesthetic and practical problems in performances and compositions of live electronic music. In this paper, we present an initial study examining the perception and understanding of artificial haptic feed- back in live electronic performances. Two groups of trumpet players participated during the study, in which short musical examples were performed with and without artificial haptic feedback. The results suggest the effec- tiveness and possible exploitable approaches of haptic feedback, as well as the performers' ease of recalibrating and adapting to new haptic feedback associations. In ad- dition to the methods utilised, technical practicalities and aesthetic issues are discussed. 1.},

However, those platforms typically target everyday programmers rather than composers and media artists. On the other hand, tangible user interface (TUI) toolkits, which provide an integrated, easy-to-use solution have not gained momentum in modern music creation. We propose a concept that hybridizes physical computing and TUI toolkit approaches. This helps to tackle typical TUI toolkit weaknesses, namely quick sensor obsolescence and limited choices. We developed a physical realization based on the idea of "universal pins," which can be configured to perform a variety of duties, making it possible to connect different sensor breakouts and modules. We evaluated our prototype by making performance measurements and conducting a user study demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile thresholds were determined as a function of frequency, contactor configuration, and contactor area. It was found that contactor area is a more important stimulus parameter than the gradient or curvature of displacement. The absolute threshold for vibration seems to be independent of frequency when very small contactors are used and independent of area at low frequencies. For higher values of these parameters, it strongly depends on both. It seems reasonable to conclude that responses to mechanical displacement of the skin are mediated by more than one receptor system, although direct evidence is still lacking.},

abstract = {In this work, the tactual information transmission capabilities of a tactual display designed to provide stimulation along a continuum from kinesthetic movements to cutaneous vibrations are assessed. The display is capable of delivering arbitrary waveforms to three digits (thumb, index, and middle finger) within an amplitude range from absolute detection threshold to about 50 dB sensation level and a frequency range from dc to above 300 Hz. Stimulus sets were designed at each of three signal durations (125, 250, and 500 msec) by combining salient attributes, such as frequency (further divided into low, middle, and high regions), amplitude, direction of motion, and finger location. Estimated static information transfer (IT) was 6.5 bits at 500 msec, 6.4 bits at 250 msec, and 5.6 bits at 125 msec. Estimates of IT rate were derived from identification experiments in which the subject's task was to identify the middle stimulus in a sequence of three stimuli randomly selected from a given stimulus set. On the basis of the extrapolations from these IT measurements to continuous streams, the IT rate was estimated to be about 12 bits/sec, which is roughly the same as that achieved by Tadoma users in tactual speech communication.},

@phdthesis{Pedrosa2007,
abstract = {When designing haptic feedback into human-computer interfaces the most common approach is to restrict its deployment to only one of the haptic channels (either force or vibrotactile feedback) and this decision is often biased according to the technological boundaries imposed by the interface design or its purpose. The research presented here outlines a methodology developed to include haptic feedback in a gesture interface used to implement a computer based music instrument. The primary goal of this research is to achieve an increased understanding of how different flavors of haptic feedback should be combined to support both controllability and comfort in expressive interfaces such as computer based musical instruments. The work reported here has two parts: 1) a description of an initial user experiment conducted for the purpose of assessing the use of vibrotactile stimuli as rhythmic cues, and 2) a proposed research trajectory which will constitute the theme for a PhD project. The main hypothesis guiding this research is that the best way to include haptic feedback into any design should start by understanding the role each haptic channel plays in the “real life scenario”. The assumption we will put into test is that the feedback provided for each haptic channel could be developed individually and later on fine tuned when mixed in the final design, and this includes that the addition of any extra cues we might be interested in supplying to the end user to enhance the real life experience should be designed and mixed in each haptic channel before the final blend occurs. This methodology could be defined as a “perception-based design”: a design approach that starts with a perceptual characterization of the interaction that is being addressed and fine tune the results according to the perceptual load put on the user senses. We expect that the knowledge gathered will be useful not only to a broader spectrum of expressive interfaces but could also be extrapolated to including haptic feedback in other interface designs.},

We begin with an observation that such vibrotactile signals are analogous to musical chords in which multiple notes are played simultaneously. A set of so-called "vibrotactile chords" are designed on the basis of musical chords, and their degrees of consonance (harmony) that participants perceive are evaluated through a perceptual experiment. Experimental results indicate that participants can reliably rate the degrees of consonance of vibrotactile chords and establish a well-defined function that relates the degree of consonance to the base and chordal frequency of a vibrotactile chord. These findings have direct implications for the design of complex vibrotactile signals that can be produced by current wideband actuators such as voice-coil, piezoelectric, and electroactive polymer actuators.},

All combinations of three feedback modes are analysed: non-speech audio, tactile, and pseudo-haptic ‘sticky' feedback. The tactile conditions used stimulation through vibration (rather than force-feedback), and the sticky conditions were implemented by dynamically reconfiguring mouse control-display gain as the cursor entered the target. Results show that for small, discretely located targets all feedback modes reduce targeting times, with stickiness providing substantial improvements. Furthermore, stickiness and tactile appear to combine well. However, the results of a more ecologically-oriented menu-selection task show the need for caution, revealing that excessive feedback can damage interaction though ‘noise' that interferes with the acquisition of neighbouring targets.},

abstract = {In an effort to understand the vibration-induced injuries incurred by manual workers, mechanical models are developed and used to predict the biodynamic responses of human body parts that are exposed to vibration. Researchers have traditionally focused on the arms and hands, but there has been only limited research on finger modeling. To simulate the accurate response of a single finger, a detailed mechanical model based on biodynamic finger measurements is necessary. However, the development of such models may prove difficult using the traditional one-point coupling method; therefore, this study proposes a new approach. A novel device for single-finger measurements is presented and used to expose the finger to a single-axial broadband excitation. The sequentially measured responses of the different finger parts are then used to identify the parameters of a multibody mechanical model of the index finger. Very good agreement between the measured and the simulated data was achieved, and the study also confirmed that the obtained index-finger model is acceptable for further biodynamic studies.},

abstract = {Active touch is often described as yielding “better-quality” information than passive touch. However, some authors have argued that passive-guided movements generate superior percepts due to a reduction in demands on the haptic sensory system. We consider the possibility that passive-guided conditions, as used in most active-passive comparisons, are relatively free from cognitive decision-making, while active conditions involve cognitive loads that are quite high and uncharacteristic of normal sensory processes. Thus studies that purport to show differences in active and passive touch may instead be revealing differences in the amount of cognition involved in active and passive tasks. We hypothesized that passive-guided conditions reduce not the sensory load but the cognitive load that active explorers must bear. To test this hypothesis Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) activity was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during active and passive-guided fingertip exploration of 2D raised line drawings. Active movements resulted in greater activation (compared with passive movements) in areas implicated in higher order processes such as monitoring and controlling of goal-directed behavior, attention, execution of movements, and error detection. Passive movements, in contrast, produced greater BOLD activity in areas associated with touch perception, length discrimination, tactile object recognition, and efference copy. The activation of a greater number of higher-order processing areas during active relative to passive-guided exploration suggests that instances of passive-guided superiority may not be due to the haptic system's limited ability to cope with sensory inputs, but rather the restriction imposed by the use of a single finger such that active exploration may require cognitive strategies not demanded in the passive condition. Our findings suggest that previous attempts to compare active and passive touch have, in order to simplify tasks, inadvertently introduced cognitive load at the expense of normal sensory inputs.},

Vertical whole-body vibrations were produced using an individually calibrated electro-dynamic shaker. A pair of closed dynamic headphones was used for audio reproduction. A loudness matching experiment was carried out with 28 participants. In this experiment, sinusoidal sounds were presented in the absence and presence of simultaneous vibrations. Participants had to match the level of the acoustic stimuli while ignoring the tactile stimulation. The loudness matching experiment was carried out for four sinusoidal tones, at the frequencies of 10, 20, 63 and 200 Hz. Three different vibration levels (4, 8 and 12 dB above the vibration threshold for each participant) were used to study the influence of the vibration amplitude. Results indicate that whole-body vibration had a significant influence on loudness perception. When an acoustic stimulus was accompanied by vibration, the level of the acoustic stimulus was perceived one decibel higher on average.},

abstract = {The objective of the study was to characterize the Pacinian representation of stimulus waveform. Subjects were presented with pairs of high-frequency vibrotactile stimuli that varied in intensity and/or frequency content and made same-different judgments under conditions of low-frequency adaptation designed to minimize the contribution of the RA system. We wished to infer the nature of the information conveyed by the Pacinian system about the stimuli from measured sensitivity (d') to stimulus differences. We first tested the hypothesis that the Pacinian system conveys only intensive information about vibratory stimuli and found that intensive cues could not account for much of the variance in the discrimination data. We then proposed a model characterizing the Pacinian-mediated representation of an arbitrary stimulus as a pattern of activation in a set of frequency-tuned minichannels. The model was shown to predict the discriminability of the stimulus pairs presented in the psychophysical experiments. Furthermore, the model parameters, optimized to fit the discrimination data, were compatible with analogous values obtained in other experimental contexts. One of the assumptions underlying the model is that information about individual spectral components is conveyed in parallel and quasi-independently. By simulating the response of a population of Pacinian afferents to a polyharmonic stimulus, we demonstrated that such a population can simultaneously convey information about multiple frequency components, despite having a homogeneous spectral profile.},

abstract = {OBJECT: To investigate whether hand-arm vibration and noise have a combined effect on temporary threshold shift (TTS) of hearing among healthy subjects. METHOD AND DESIGN: Nineteen healthy subjects with an average age of 25.7 (SD 7.7) years were exposed to vibration (30 m/s2, 60 Hz), noise [90 dB(A)] and both, respectively. The subject's right hand was placed on the plate of a vibrator and the right ear exposed to noise via headphones. Subjects were exposed to vibration and/or noise for 3 min and after a 1-min pause the exposure was repeated five times. Hearing thresholds at 1, 4 and 6 kHz were measured during the time periods before, between (during pauses) and after exposure. RESULTS: Exposure to vibration alone caused almost no hearing threshold changes at every frequency tested. But exposure to noise or a combination of vibration and noise caused a significant increase in TTSs at 4 and 6 kHz. Moreover, exposure to a combination of vibration and noise caused significantly higher TTSs than exposure to noise at 4 and 6 kHz. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate the combined effects of hand-arm vibration and noise can enhance exposure to hand-arm vibration and noise can enhance the TTS of hearing more than noise exposure, though hand-arm vibration alone may hardly affect TTS.},

@article{LagardeKelso:movementSoundTouch,
abstract = {Very little is known about the coordination of movement in combination with stimuli such as sound and touch. The present research investigates the hypothesis that both the type of action (e.g., a flexion or extension movement) and the sensory modality (e.g., auditory or tactile) determine the stability of multimodal coordination. We performed a parametric study in which the ability to synchronize movement, touch and sound was explored over a broad range of stimulus frequencies or rates. As expected, synchronization of finger movement with external auditory and tactile stimuli was successfully established and maintained across all frequencies. In the key experimental conditions, participants were instructed to synchronize peak flexion of the index finger with touch and peak extension with sound (and vice-versa). In this situation, tactile and auditory stimuli were delivered counter-phase to each other. Two key effects were observed. First, switching between multimodal coordination patterns occurred, with transitions selecting one multimodal pattern (flexion with sound and extension with touch) more often than its partner. This finding indicates that the stability of multimodal coordination is influenced by both the type of action and the stimulus modality. Second, at higher rates, transitions from coherent to incoherent phase relations between touch, movement and sound occurred, attesting to the breakdown of multimodal coordination. Because timing errors in multimodal coordination were systematically altered when compared to unimodal control conditions we are led to consider the role played by time delays in multimodal coordination dynamics.},

We investigated whether auditory localization judgments could also be affected by the presentation of spatially displaced tactile stimuli, using a procedure designed to reveal perceptual interactions across modalities. Participants made left-right discrimination responses regarding the perceived location of sounds, which were presented either in isolation or together with tactile stimulation to the fingertips. The results demonstrate that the apparent location of a sound can be biased toward tactile stimulation when it is synchronous, but not when it is asynchronous, with the auditory event. Directing attention to the tactile modality did not increase the bias of sound localization toward synchronous tactile stimulation. These results provide the first demonstration of the tactile capture of audition.},

In the same way that auditory information is available and used throughout a performance, a musician will continuously reassess their playing by making use of not only their specialised sensorimotor skills, but also the tangible feedback that is relayed to them through the body of the instrument. This paper discusses approaches to the development of an augmented instrument, namely the hybrid piano, which focuses on the notion of performance as perceptually guided action. While the acoustic component of the sound energy of the augmented instrument is created within the real- world interactions between hammers, resonating strings, and the soundboard, the digital sonic events cannot be located in a similar palpable source. By exploring notions of multimodality and haptic feedback, the ongoing processes of human action and perception within instrumental performance can be maintained for the player, whilst arguably, also enhancing the experience for the listener.},

abstract = {Perceptual integration of vibrotactile and auditory sinusoidal tone pulses was studied in detection experiments as a function of stimulation frequency. Vibrotactile stimuli were delivered through a single channel vibrator to the left middle fingertip. Auditory stimuli were presented diotically through headphones in a background of 50 dB sound pressure level broadband noise. Detection performance for combined auditory-tactile presentations was measured using stimulus levels that yielded 63{\%} to 77{\%} correct unimodal performance. In Experiment 1, the vibrotactile stimulus was 250 Hz and the auditory stimulus varied between 125 and 2000 Hz. In Experiment 2, the auditory stimulus was 250 Hz and the tactile stimulus varied between 50 and 400 Hz. In Experiment 3, the auditory and tactile stimuli were always equal in frequency and ranged from 50 to 400 Hz. The highest rates of detection for the combined-modality stimulus were obtained when stimulating frequencies in the two modalities were equal or closely spaced (and within the Pacinian range). Combined-modality detection for closely spaced frequencies was generally consistent with an algebraic sum model of perceptual integration; wider-frequency spacings were generally better fit by a Pythagorean sum model. Thus, perceptual integration of auditory and tactile stimuli at near-threshold levels appears to depend both on absolute frequency and relative frequency of stimulation within each modality.},

abstract = {The vibration levels in four traditional stringed instruments during playing have been investigated, including the double bass, violin, guitar, and the piano. The vibration levels, which were measured at several positions and at different dynamic levels, were evaluated with respect to reported thresholds for detection of vibrotactile stimuli. The results show that the vibration levels are well above threshold for almost all positions on the instruments in normal playing. It is concluded that the perceived vibrations may be of some assistance with regard to intonation in ensemble playing, in particular for the bass instruments. The finger forces exerted when playing the bowed strings, as well as the touch forces in piano playing were studied briefly. It was concluded that the kinesthetic forces perceived in playing may assist the timing in performance.},

abstract = {The touch used to play the piano, representing aspects of body posture, hand posture, movement, speed, force and pressure on the key, has been addressed over the centuries by pedagogues, famous pianists and composers. Piano touch not only underpins basic technique in piano playing, but is also the route through which pianists can communicate their expressive intentions. This review pulls together literature concerning touch from piano pedagogy, engineering, performance analysis and biomechanics. Studies have advanced understanding in the actions behind a typical keypress motion, the influence of training by examining differences between novice and expert pianists, and the various joint contributions that discern a struck versus a pressed touch. Although individual differences are widely identified, the influence of hand anthropometry, choice of technique and difference in training between experts remains understudied. A trade-off between accuracy and ecological validity is also identified in the use of current measurement systems: to encourage wider participation and incorporation into instrumental lessons, there is a need for the development of un-intrusive measurement systems that can be used outside the laboratory environment without restrictions concerning the instrument. Implications include furthering understanding across the arts and sciences and aiding teachers and students looking to minimise the risk of injury.},

@article{Schmelt2018,
abstract = {In this paper, a bimodal tactile display used to stimulate the mechanoreceptors is proposed. The use of tactile displays to provide tactile sensations has become the object of increasing interest in recent years. Most of these displays have only one actuator type to generate the tactile perceptions and the spatial resolution of many displays is too rough for good tactile impression. Hence, for the proposed tactile display, two types of actuators for lateral and vertical (normal) excitation are combined. The resolution of the 4 × 4 array is 2.4 mm. Due to its design concept, the presented display is easily expanded. The normal actuator is based on the reluctance principle and the lateral actuator is based on the piezoelectric effect. This contribution focuses on the design and characterization of the piezoelectric actuator. The lateral actuator is mounted on the normal actuator. This has a significant impact on the design of the piezoelectric actuator. To describe the dynamics of this actuator, a Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) Model is created. The mechanical boundary condition at the connection to the normal actuator is included utilizing discrete elements. The model is validated by experiments. Using the model, the geometry of the actuator elements is designed. For performance tests, several experiments have been carried out. The behavior of the lateral actuator has been analyzed in the two end positions of the normal actuators for different load conditions. In terms of performance, the lateral actuators achieve sufficient deflection, even under high load conditions, using imitation human skin as the contact material and with a weight of 50 g. It is shown in a subject test that the lateral actuator works well under real conditions. A measurement of the combined movement has been performed using a Micro System Analyzer (MSA-100-3D) at different frequencies.},

abstract = {In this paper, a basic study for breakthrough in tactile presentation technology is described to progress tactile displays using velvet hand illusion (VHI). In the VHI, a person rubs his/her hands together on either side of wires strung through a frame, producing the sensation of rubbing a very smooth and soft surface like velvet. Since in VHI human subjects feel the surface like velvet that does not actually exist, we might develop a new tactile display capable of generating feeling of material based on the mechanism of VHI. The objective of this study is to elucidate this mechanism. We investigate the VHI using frames equipped with two parallel wires and a series of psychophysical experiments. According to the experiments using Thurstone's Paired Comparison, the strength of VHI depends on the wire distance and movement stroke, and VHI caused by passive touch is considerably stronger than that caused by active touch. This result suggests that VHI is controlled by mechanical external stimulation using tactile displays. Furthermore, we found that the strongest VHI is obtained at movement stroke r being approximately equal to wire distance D. According to the abovementioned results, the mechanism of VHI is assumed as follows: although the area bounded by two wires moves relative to the hands, tangential force does not occur on the hand surface except for wire-passing portion, causing operators to experience the illusion of touching a smooth virtual film with a zero coefficient of friction. Since VHI becomes weaker with a small distance between two adjacent wires or a large movement stroke, excessive tangential stimulation prevents the occurrence of VHI.},

@inproceedings{JackAl2016:latencyDMI,
abstract = {When designing digital musical instruments the importance of low and consistent action-to-sound latency is widely accepted. This paper investigates the effects of latency (0- 20ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer inter- action. We present findings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condi- tion, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms ± 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was significantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no significant difference in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no significant difference in mean synchronisa- tion error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an in- strument, but without significantly affecting the timing per- formance of our participants. These findings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},

@article{LamoreKeemink:VibesThreshForce,
abstract = {The shape of the psychophysical frequency threshold curve for vibrations presented to the skin in the frequency region 5-1000 Hz is strongly dependent on the static force that the vibrator exerts on the skin and on whether there is a rigid surround around the vibrating contactor (presence of contrast). Where there is no rigid surround, an increase in static force reduces the threshold in the high-frequency region and increases it at low frequencies. When the static forces are sufficiently large, the thresholds reach a minimum value above 30 Hz and a maximum one below 30 Hz, this being the crossover frequency. Under these conditions in the frequency region around 200 Hz, where the threshold is determined by the Pacini receptor system, the vibration sensitivities of finger pad and thenar eminence (glabrous skin) are equal, while the value for the inner side of the forearm (hairy skin) is 12 dB higher. However, when a rigid surround is used, the threshold increases above 30 Hz and decreases below 30 Hz. The latter increase in sensitivity, which is introduced by the presence of contrast cues, amounts to about 20 dB and is sharply tuned at 18 Hz for the glabrous skin of the finger. It is argued that in this case the threshold is determined by the Meissner receptor system. This increase in sensitivity is less pronounced (about 10 dB) and less sharply tuned for the other sites. Finally, when the contact of the vibrating surface to the skin is at a minimum, the vibration threshold has the same displacement value (about 3 microns) over the whole frequency region independent of the site of stimulation and whether or not a rigid surround is present.},

The results also suggest that it is possible to know a priori the amount of noise needed for optimal SR effects given the degree to which the signal is subthreshold.

abstract = {The human nervous system displays remarkable functional plasticity following long-term sensory deprivation. For example, the auditory cortex of congenitally deaf humans may start to process tactile information. To further explore this type of cross-modal plasticity, we examined the tactile accuracy of congenitally deaf and normal hearing subjects in frequency discrimination and in detection of random suprathreshold frequency changes within a monotonous sequence of vibratory stimuli. We found that congenital deafness can enhance the accuracy of suprathreshold tactile change detection while tactile frequency discrimination is not significantly changed, although there is a trend toward reduced thresholds. The enhanced tactile sensitivity in the deaf probably reflects both neural plasticity and increased attention directed to the stimuli. Whatever the underlying neural mechanisms might be, functional compensation following early sensory loss apparently leads the remaining sensory modalities to develop capacities exceeding those of the normal functional systems.},

Here, it is shown that lateral force, and correlates such as acceleration and velocity, are inherently ambiguous as shape cues under passive touch conditions. The lateral forces arising when passively touching objects with different shapes can be equal. Lateral force ambiguity can also happen during active touch, when an object moves relative to a subject's limb. Lateral force ambiguity may be used to explore two important, unsolved questions: whether active and passive touch percepts are equivalent, and whether they arise from the same brain mechanisms. A method is proposed, and used, to generate geometryless, force-matched stimuli to compare the role of lateral force during active and passive touch, while minimizing other cues. Such comparisons have been extremely hard to make because of the difficulty to meaningfully match the many factors involved.},

The present study measured vibrotactile spatial summation at suprathreshold amplitudes. A matching- task was used to investig-ate the effect of varying contactor size on sensory magnitude at three different vibration frequencies. Unlike the threshold data, increasing contactor size resulted in increases in sensory magnitude at 25 and 40 Hz as well as at 160 Hz. The amount of summation varied directly with amplitude for the two lower frequencies. In a second experiment, the effect of increasing static force, independent of contactor size, was investigated. The results indicated that the spatial summation effects noted in the first experiment may be due to increases in static force and not contactor area. The implications of these results for the concept of spatial summation and for the duplex mechanoreceptor hypothesis are discussed.},

Twelve expert touch typists copy-typed sentences on a computer keyboard without vision of their hands or the computer screen. Following control trials, their right index fingertip was anesthetized, and sentences were typed again. The movements of the finger were recorded with an instrumented glove and electromagnetic position sensor. During anesthesia, typing errors of that finger increased sevenfold. While the inter-keypress timing and average kinematics were unaffected, there was an increase in variability of all measures. Regression analysis showed that endpoint variability was largely accounted for by start location variability. The results suggest that tactile cues provide information about the start location of the finger, which is necessary to perform typing movements accurately.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a tool known as the Haptic Drum Kit, which employs four computer-controlled vibrotactile devices, one attached to each wrist and ankle. In the applications discussed here, haptic pulses are used to guide the playing, on a drum kit, of rhythmic patterns that require multi-limb co-ordination. The immediate aim is to foster rhythm skills and multi-limb coordination. A broader aim is to systematically develop skills in recognizing, identifying, memorizing, retaining, analyzing, reproducing, and composing polyphonic rhythms. We consider the implications of three different theories for this approach: the work of the music educator Dalcroze (1865-1950 [1]; the entrainment theory of human rhythm perception and production [2,3]; and sensory motor contingency theory [4]. In this paper we report on a design study; and identify and discuss a variety of emerging design issues. The study demonstrates that beginning drummers are able to learn intricate drum patterns from haptic stimuli alone.},

abstract = {Haptic interfaces controlled by a single fingertip or hand-held probe tend to display surface features individually, requiring serial search for multiple features. Novel surface haptic devices, however, have the potential to provide displays to multiple fingertips simultaneously, affording the possibility of parallel search. Using variable-friction surface haptic devices, we investigated the ability of participants to detect a target feature among a set of distractors in parallel across the fingers. We found that searches for a material property (slipperiness) and an illusory shape (virtual hole) were significantly impaired by distractors, while search for an abrupt discontinuity (virtual edge) was not. The efficiency of search for edges rendered by surface haptics suggests that they engage primitive detectors in the haptic perceptual system.},

abstract = {The body's sense of touch is potentially a versatile channel for the conveyance of directional, spatial, command, and timing information. Most practical implementations of vibrotactile systems require compact, light-weight actuators that can be mounted against the body. Eccentric mass motors are widely used for this application, yet their output is limited and the effects of loading on the transducers due to the skin and mounting arrangement have been largely ignored. Conventional linear actuators are well suited as vibrotactile transducers and can provide high output, but are typically limited to laboratory research due to their large size and cost. The effect of loading on various practical vibrotactile transducers is investigated using a skin impedance phantom and measuring the transducer displacement with respect to additional mass loading. Depending on the transducer design, loading can dramatically reduce the vibratory displacement and, in the case of eccentric mass motors, also increase the operating frequency. In contrast, a new linear actuator design can be designed to be almost independent of skin loading, by considering the mechanical impedance of the load and optimizing the transducer contact area.},

Currently, such dexterous manual tasks can be an input source of computing. To design appropriate vibrotactile stimuli for manual tasks, it is essential to quantify human vibrotactile sensitivity over a large range of contact forces. In this paper, we report the psychophysical detection thresholds for vibrotactile stimuli measured for five pressing forces that cover the range of forces encountered during ordinary manual tasks. The experimental results showed stark contrasts between stimulus frequencies, depending on actively exerted pressing force. The detection thresholds for 40 Hz stimuli first increased then decreased as the pressing force increased, but the detection thresholds for 250 Hz stimuli generally decreased as the force increased. These results have immediate consequences on the design of vibrotactile feedback for manual tasks in many applications of tangible interaction, tele-operation, and VR.},

Vibrotactile thresholds at six frequencies from 8 to 250 Hz were measured on the distal phalanx of the index finger, the volar forearm, the large toe, and the heel with two contactors: (i) a 1-mm diameter circular probe with a 1-mm gap to a fixed circular surround (i.e., 7.1-mm(2) excitation area), and (ii) a 6-mm diameter circular probe with a 2-mm gap to a fixed circular surround (i.e., 79-mm(2) excitation area). At all frequencies and with both contactors, thresholds on the fingertip were lower than thresholds on the volar forearm, the large toe, and the heel, consistent with a greater density of mechanoreceptors at the fingertip. Thresholds with the larger contactor were lower than thresholds with the smaller contactor on the fingertip at high frequencies (63, 125, and 250 Hz), on the large toe (except at 250 Hz), on the heel (at all frequencies), and on the volar forearm at 250 Hz. It is concluded that at least two tactile channels (Pacinian from 63 to 250 Hz, and non-Pacinian from 8 to 31.5 Hz) determined vibrotactile thresholds at the fingertip, whereas non-Pacinian channels had a dominant influence on vibrotactile thresholds at the volar forearm. The role of Pacinian and non-Pacinian channels could not be confirmed at the large toe or the heel despite some evidence of spatial summation.},

abstract = {A computational model based on previous physiological and psychophysical data is presented for the human Pacinian (P) psychophysical channel. The model can predict the probability of detection in simple psychophysical tasks, and hence psychometric functions and thresholds. The model simulates stimulating variable and fixed glabrous skin sites with different-sized contactors and includes spatial variation of monkey P-fiber sensitivities. Therefore, it is especially suitable for studying spatial summation, i.e. the improvement of threshold with increasing contactor area. Selective contributions of neural integration (n.i.) and probability summation (p.s.) are also incorporated into the model. Model predictions are compared to psychophysical results of Gescheider et al. (2005). The performance of the model regarding the effects of contactor size is very good. In addition to predicting approximately 3 dB improvement of thresholds when the contactor area is doubled, the model also reveals nonlinear contributions of p.s. and n.i. Furthermore, the model asserts that thresholds are largely governed by neural integration when small contactors are used. These and other findings discussed in the article show that the presented model is a helpful tool for formulating testable hypotheses. Although the model can also simulate some temporal summation effects, simulation results do not conform well to previous data on temporal response properties. Thus, the model needs to be refined in that respect.},

The tactile display is composed of a6 × 5 pin array actuated by 30 piezoelectric bimorphs. The distance between each pin's centers is 1.8 mm. Vertical excursion of each pin is controlled over a 0–0.7 mm range. Perceptual experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the system under three conditions: active touch, passive touch with vibration and passive touch without vibration. The experimental results showed that vibrational stimuli helped subjects discriminate tactile patterns. Measurements of the error rate during discrimination tasks were used to find an optimal vibration frequency for stimuli presented at a constant sensation level (32 SLdB above threshold). The experiment was repeated, this time holding the energy transferred mechanically to the fingertip tissue constant. At low frequencies, we found that the passive stimulation allowed subjects to discriminate just as well as active touch of static stimuli did. The results suggested newpossibilities for displaying texture using passive touch, constant energy and spatially varied vibration frequency. Keywords:},

The results largely replicated the data reported by Gates and Bradshaw (1974): performance in the ansence of auditory feedback showed no impairment, whereas performance under delayed auditory feedback showed significant impairment. In an extension of the Gates and Bradshaw study, however, it was found that altered pitch feedback caused little or no impairment and that altering th pitches in the delayed auditory feedback condition significantly reduced the amount of delayed auditory feedback impairment. These results show that different components of auditory feedback (pitch and timing) have separable effects on musical performance and pose a problem for theories of auditory feedback effects that do not explicity distinguish these components.},

Here we examined how the automatic implicit reactions induced by viewing task-irrelevant, real moving objects influence tactile duration judgments. Participants were asked to make temporal bisection judgments of a tactile event while seeing a potentially catchable swinging ball. Approaching movement induced a tactile-duration overestimation relative to lateral movement and to a static baseline, and receding movement produced an expansion similar in duration to that from approaching movement. Interestingly, the effect of approaching movement on the subjective tactile duration was greatly reduced when participants held lightweight objects in their hands, relative to a hands-free condition, whereas no difference was obtained in the tactile-duration estimates between static hands-free and static hands-occupied conditions. The results indicate that duration perception is determined by internal bodily states as well as by sensory evidence.},

@article{Chapman1994,
abstract = {Active and passive touch, respectively with and without voluntary movement on the part of the subject, are frequently reported to be equivalent in terms of the resultant perceptual abilities. This review reexamines the notion of perceptual equivalence in the light of growing evidence that the transmission of tactile inputs is diminished, or "gated," during the course of active movement. It is concluded that there is indeed gating of cutaneous inputs during active touch. In most experiments, the paradoxical observation of perceptual equivalence between active and passive touch can partly be explained by the choice of task, namely, tactile discriminations that depend on relative, and not absolute, differences in inputs. The surprising lack of evidence for any superiority of passive touch over active touch can likely be explained by several factors. First, performance with active touch may be enhanced by the motor strategy, e.g., by reducing the speed of movement at critical points, and so reducing the degree of gating, and (or) by optimally orienting the exploring digits so as to bring the most sensitive skin areas into contact with the object in question. Second, central influences, including attention and motor set, may be specifically activated during voluntary movement and contribute to enhancing performance during active touch. Thus, the gating influences associated with active touch may be offset, partly or wholly, by the combined influence of these factors to yield (near) perceptual equivalence for active and passive touch.},

abstract = {In R {\&} D departments of companies, the evaluation of sounds usually is based on physical measurements. However, in "real life", the ultimate judge for sounds is the human hearing system. A customer evaluates the sound of a product by his or her hearing system, not by physical measurement tools, whatever their sophistication may be. In this situation, psychoacoustics is the scientific field of choice to bridge the gap between physical and subjective evaluations. In psychoacoustic experiments, firm relations between the physical representations of sounds and the correlated hearing sensations are established. In practical applications of psychoacoustics, two main tasks can be distinguished: First, questions of sound evaluation, usually for already existing sounds which often have to be improved and Second, questions of sound quality engineering, where for a (new or modified) product or application a suitable sound has to be "tailored". For the evaluation of sounds, basic psychoacoustic magnitudes like loudness and sharpness have proven successful, which assess volume or power and tone color of sounds, respectively. Using these descriptors, extremely different questions like the quality of piano sounds or the annoyance of snoring sounds can be assessed. In addition, psychoacoustic magnitudes related to the temporal structure of sounds like fluctuation strength or roughness can play an important part. In sound quality engineering, for each sound, the right "recipe" has to be found, how to mix the different hearing sensations, to arrive at the desired sound. For the example of warning signals, a systematic approach, incorporating elements of decision tree studies, is discussed.},

abstract = {To study the effects of touch on auditory processing, we examined whether uninformative and irrelevant tactile stimuli presented together with task-relevant sounds can improve auditory detection (Experiment 1), and enhance perceived loudness (Experiment 2). We demonstrated that irrelevant tactile signals facilitate the detection of faint tones, and increase auditory intensity ratings. These crossmodal facilitation effects were found for synchronous when compared to asynchronous auditory-tactile stimulation, and were stronger for weaker than for louder sounds. They are interpreted in terms of a multisensory integration mechanism that increases the strength of auditory signals, and adheres to the rules of inverse effectiveness and temporal (but not spatial) co-occurrence. This integration might be mediated by auditory-tactile multisensory neurons in regions of auditory association cortex that are also involved in auditory detection and loudness discrimination.},

abstract = {Currently, most of multi-touch surface tables do not provide any tactile feedback to the users. In this paper, a multi-touch surface table with tactile feedback is proposed. The proposed surface table provides the users with the ability of multi-point tactile feedback with variant patterns and levels of vibrations. A webcam is used to capture all finger-touch images as system inputs using computer vision. Interactive computer graphics is generated and projected on the surface table. In addition, the multi-point tactile feedback is produced by multiple motors attached below the display surface. Hence, the user will receive tactile feedback synchronized with multi-point interactive computer graphics.},

abstract = {This work investigates how haptic percepts are combined across two fingertips. Two single-degree-of-freedom haptic interfaces were used to present virtual bumps to the thumb and index finger of subjects' right hand. As subjects slid the two interfaces from left to right while maintaining a fixed finger separation, they would encounter one bump with the index finger and one with the thumb. The objective bump locations were varied randomly, from spatially coincident to separated by slightly more than the fingertips. Subjects were asked to report the number of bumps in the objective world and the number of times they encountered each bump, and also to point to the locations of the bumps. We found that subjects exhibited a strong bias toward reporting a single objective bump in the virtual world. However, the percept varied from one bump encountered twice, when the two virtual bumps were nearly spatially coincident, to one bump encountered once, which occurred when the two virtual bumps were close to finger separation and therefore encountered nearly simultaneously. The latter result is evidence for a kinesthetic grouping phenomenon: temporally synchronized sensations at multiple fingers can be perceptually collapsed into a single percept in both time and space.},

Using a two alternative forced choice staircase procedure, the points of subjective equivalence were estimated for the 0.4 s long reference stimulus.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to shed light on cortical audiotactile integration and sensory substitution mechanisms, thought to serve as a basis for the use of a sensor glove in the preservation of the cortical map of the hand after peripheral nerve injuries. Fourteen subjects were selected and randomly assigned either to a training group, trained to replace touch for hearing with the use of a sensor glove, or to a control group, untrained. Training group volunteers had to identify textures just by the sound. In an fMRI experiment, all subjects received three types of stimuli: tactile only, combined audiotactile stimulation, and auditory only. Results indicate that, for trained subjects, a coupling between auditory and somatosensory cortical areas is established through associative areas. Differences in signal correlation between groups point to a pairing mechanism, which, at first, connects functionally the primary auditory and sensory areas (trained subjects). Later, this connection seems to be mediated by associative areas. The training with the sensor glove influences cortical audiotactile integration mechanisms, determining BOLD signal changes in the somatosensory area during auditory stimulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional force transducer was installed in the neck of a violin under the A string at the D5 position in order to study the force with which the violinist clamps the string against the fingerboard under normal playing conditions. Violinists performed repetitive sequences of open A- and fingered D-tones using the ring finger at tempi of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 notes/s at mezzo-forte. At selected tempi, the effects of dynamic level and the use of different fingers were investigated as well. The force profiles were clearly dependent on tempo and dynamic level. At slow tempi, the force profiles were characterized by an initial pulse followed by a level force to the end of the finger contact period. At tempi higher than 2 Hz, only pulsed profiles were observed. The peak force exceeded 4.5 N at 1 and 2 Hz and decreased to 1.7 N at 16 Hz. All force and impulse values were lower at softer dynamic levels, and when using the ring or little finger compared to the index finger.},

abstract = {Vibration feedback is one of the most popular ways to communicate between human and haptic interfaces nowadays. In order to deliver a wider variety of information accurately and efficiently, significant design factors of the vibration need to be investigated and applied to haptic devices. In this study, the excitatory direction was examined as a design factor of the vibration in terms of sensitivity and emotion. We conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, the sensitivities of three excitatory directions—X (lateral), Y (fore-and-aft) and Z (vertical) axes were estimated by the absolute thresholds of the vibration perception with two frequency levels (150 and 280 Hz). Based on ten participants' estimated absolute thresholds, we conclude that the vibration with X axis is less sensitive than Z axis at the frequency of 150 Hz, while the vibration with Y axis is less sensitive than Z axis at the frequency of 280 Hz. In the second experiment, the agreeability of 29 emotional expressions to the vibrations was measured by a 7-point scale with a total of 12 conditions (2 frequencies × 2 amplitudes (i.e., 50 × 10−3 and 500 × 10−3 g) × 3 excitatory directions). Based on 20 participants' responses, it is concluded that at the frequency of 150 Hz and the amplitude of 50 × 10−3 g, the vibration is perceived as ‘light', and as even ‘lighter' if the vibration is with Y axis rather than with Z axis. Likewise, at the frequency of 150 Hz and the amplitude of 500 × 10−3 g, the vibration is perceived as ‘repulsive', and as even ‘more repulsive' if the vibration is with Y or Z axis rather than with X axis. Therefore, three excitatory directions can be selectively utilized to design the distinguishable vibration by its sensitivity and emotion.},

abstract = {There is a longstanding disconnect between mechanical models of the piano, in which key velocity is the sole determinant of each note's sound, and the subjective experience of trained pianists, who take a nuanced, multidimensional approach to physical gestures at the keyboard (commonly known as “touch”). We seek to peel back the abstraction of the key press as a discrete event, developing models of key touch that link qualitative musical intention to quantitative key motion. The interaction between performer and instrument (whether acoustic or electronic) can be considered a special case of human-machine interaction, and one that takes place on far different terms than ordinary human-computer interaction: a player's physical gestures are often the result of intuitive, subconscious processes. Our proposed models will therefore aid the development of computer interfaces which connect with human users on an intuitive, expressive level, with applications within and beyond the musical domain. 7.1},

In this paper, the relative roles of force/displacement and surface deformation cues are investigated. We have measured discrimination thresholds with silicone rubber stimuli of differing thickness and compliance. Also, the influence of the finger span is assessed. When compliance is expressed as the Young's modulus, the thresholds in the different conditions follow Weber's law with a Weber fraction of 15 percent. When the surface deformation cue was removed, thresholds more than trebled. Under the assumption of optimal cue combination, this suggests that a large fraction of the information comes from the surface deformation cue. Using a matching experiment, we found that differences in object thickness are correctly taken into account. When cues appear to contradict each other, the conflict is resolved by means of a compromise.},

abstract = {We investigated the gating effect of passive and active movement on the vibrotactile detection thresholds of the Pacinian (P) psychophysical channel and forward masking. Previous work on gating mostly used electrocutaneous stimulation and did not allow focusing on tactile submodalities. Ten healthy adults participated in our study. Passive movement was achieved by swinging a platform, on which the participant's stimulated hand was attached, manually by a trained operator. The root-mean-square value of the movement speed was kept in a narrow range (slow: 10-20 cm/s, fast: 50-60 cm/s). Active movement was performed by the participant him-/herself using the same apparatus. The tactile stimuli consisted of 250-Hz sinusoidal mechanical vibrations, which were generated by a shaker mounted on the movement platform and applied to the middle fingertip. In the forward-masking experiments, a high-level masking stimulus preceded the test stimulus. Each movement condition was tested separately in a two-interval forced-choice detection task. Both passive and active movement caused a robust gating effect, that is, elevation of thresholds, in the fast speed range. Statistically significant change of thresholds was not found in slow movement conditions. Passive movement yielded higher thresholds than those measured during active movement, but this could not be confirmed statistically. On the other hand, the effect of forward masking was approximately constant as the movement condition varied. These results imply that gating depends on both peripheral and central factors in the P channel. Active movement may have some facilitatory role and produce less gating. Additionally, the results support the hypothesis regarding a critical speed for gating, which may be relevant for daily situations involving vibrations transmitted through grasped objects and for manual exploration.},

abstract = {Active, self-touch and the passive touch from an external source engage comparable afferent mechanoreceptors on the touched skin site. However, touch directed to glabrous skin compared to hairy skin will activate different types of afferent mechanoreceptors. Despite perceptual similarities between touch to different body sites, it is likely that the touch information is processed differently. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the cortical differences in the neural signal of touch representations during active, self-touch and passive touch from another, to both glabrous (palm) and hairy (arm) skin, where a soft brush was used as the stimulus. There were two active touch conditions, where the participant used the brush in their right hand to stroke either their left palm or arm. There were two similar passive, touch conditions where the experimenter used an identical brush to stroke the same palm and arm areas on the participant. Touch on the left palm elicited a large, significant, positive blood-oxygenation level dependence (BOLD) signal in right sensorimotor areas. Less extensive activity was found for touch to the arm. Separate somatotopical palm and arm representations were found in Brodmann area (BA) 3 of the right primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and in both these areas, active stroking gave significantly higher signals than passive stroking. Active, self-touch elicited a positive BOLD signal in a network of sensorimotor cortical areas in the left hemisphere, compared to the resting baseline. In contrast, during passive touch, a significant negative BOLD signal was found in the left SI. Thus, each of the four conditions had a unique cortical signature despite similarities in afferent signaling or evoked perception. It is hypothesized that attentional mechanisms play a role in the modulation of the touch signal in the right SI, accounting for the differences found between active and passive touch.},

A minishaker moved the stylus along its length so that the majority of vibrations were presented tangentially to the skin of the hand. The measured position thresholds decreased initially with an increasing stimulus frequency and formed a U-shaped curve in the high frequency region. The thresholds of high frequency vibrations were lower than those reported previously for vibrations that were perpendicular to the skin, but were similar to the thresholds reported earlier using vibrations that were tangential to the skin. A similar force threshold curve was obtained using a force sensor attached to one end of the stylus. Mechanical impedance of the skin derived from velocity estimates and force measurements indicated that the skin and tissues in the hand holding the stylus can be modeled with mass-, damper- and spring-like elements. A comparison of the mechanical impedance from the present study with those reported previously showed similar results for vibrations delivered in the tangential and normal directions to the skin},

abstract = {The relationship between the key depression force on an upright piano and the level of loudness of a generated tone was examined when pianists hit a force-sensor built-in key with "struck" or "pressed" type of touch. The vertical displacement of the key, and the radiated piano sounds were also recorded. It was found that for both types of touch, simple exponential functions could adequately describe the relation of the force amplitude with the level of the piano tone as well as that of the impulse of the force with the piano tone. The impulse of the force generated before the maximum key depression moment commonly amounted to above 80{\%} of the total impulse produced at the tone below mezzo-forte. It, however, decreased to around 60{\%} at fortissimo, indicating a decrease in the efficiency of the force application for sound production. The two types of touch differed in their force profiles. The struck touch was characterized by a steeper initial force increase with greater fluctuations in the subsequent period than the pressed touch. The struck touch also demonstrated lower maximum force and less impulse at fortissimo. The inter-pianist variation in the force and impulse, and the "finger-noise" are also herein examined.},

abstract = {Previous research has shown that grip and load forces are modulated simultaneously during manipulation of a hand-held object. This close temporal coupling suggested that both forces are controlled by an internal model within the CNS that predicts the changes in tangential force on the fingers. The objective of the present study was to examine how the internal model would compensate for the loss of cutaneous sensation through local anesthesia of the index and thumb. Ten healthy adult subjects (5 men and 5 women aged 20-57 yr) were asked to grasp, lift, and hold stationary, a 250 g object for 20 s. Next, the subjects were asked to perform vertical oscillatory movements over a distance of 20 cm at a rate of 1.0 Hz for 30 s. Eleven trials were performed with intact sensation, and 11 trials after a local ring-block anesthesia of the index and thumb with bupivacain (5 mg/ml). During static holding, loss of cutaneous sensation produced a significant increase in the safety margin. However, the grip force declined significantly over the 20-s static hold period. During oscillatory arm movements, grip and load forces were continuously modulated together in a predictive manner as suggested by Flanagan and Wing. Again, the grip force declined over the 30-s movement, and 7/10 subjects dropped the object at least once. With intact sensation, the object was never dropped; but with the fingers anesthetized, it was dropped on 36{\%} of the trials, and a significant slip occurred on a further 12{\%}. The mean correlation between the grip and load forces for all subjects deteriorated from 0.71 with intact sensation to 0.48 after digital anesthesia. However, a cross-correlation calculated between the grip and load forces indicated that the phase lag was approximately zero both with and without digital anesthesia. Taken together, the data from the present study suggest that cutaneous afferents are required for setting and maintaining the background level of the grip force in addition to their phasic slip-detection function and their role in adapting the grip force/load force ratio to the friction on initial contact with an object. Finally, at a more theoretical level, they correct and maintain an internal model of the physical properties of hand-held objects.},

abstract = {Certain sounds, such as fingernails screeching down a chalkboard, have a strong association with somatosensory percepts. In order to assess the influences of audition on somatosensory perception, three experiments measured how task-irrelevant auditory stimuli alter detection rates for near-threshold somatosensory stimuli. In Experiment 1, we showed that a simultaneous auditory stimulus increases sensitivity, but not response biases, to the detection of an electrical cutaneous stimulus delivered to the hand. Experiment 2 demonstrated that this enhancement of somatosensory perception is spatially specific--only monaural sounds on the same side increased detection. Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of audition on touch are also frequency dependent--only sounds with the same frequency as the vibrotactile frequency enhanced tactile detection. These results indicate that auditory information influences touch perception in highly systematic ways and suggest that similar coding mechanisms may underlie the processing of information from these different sensory modalities.},

abstract = {Vacuum cleaners are widely used household appliances and they usually generate quite unpleasant sound. The four most common sources of vacuum cleaner noise are the motor, the fan, the airflow and the surface vibrations. Connections between the motor and such vibrating surfaces of a vacuum cleaner allow very efficient transmission of the force and the motion, which are then transformed to sound. The surface velocity, the sound pressure and the acoustic power of the vibrating surfaces are very important parameters in the noise control and source location problems. The purpose of this study is to asses the vibro-acoustical characteristics of a sample wet and dry type vacuum cleaner and to determine the acoustic power radiated from this type of vacuum cleaner. For this purpose, the near-field sound pressure, the surface velocity and the sound intensity levels are measured. By using these measurements, the sound intensity, the near-field sound pressure and the surface velocity mappings are generated and using these measurements, the sound intensity compares the results compared to find the effects of the vibrating surfaces on the total vacuum cleaner sound power level.

abstract = {This article addresses the problem of producing independent tactile stimuli to multiple fingers exploring a transparent solid surface without the need to track their positions. To this end, wave time-reversal was applied to re-focus displacement impulses in time and in space at one or several locations in a thin glass plate. This result was achieved using ultrasonic bending waves produced by a set of lamellar piezoelectric actuators bonded at the periphery of the plate. Starting from first principles, the relations linking implementatin pˆarameters to the performance of the display are developed. The mechanical design of the display, signal processing and driving electronics are described. A set of engineering tradeoffs are made explicit and used for the design of a mock up device comprising a glass plate 148 × 210 × 0.5 mm. Tests indicate that a peak amplitude of 7 m confined to a 20 mm2 region could be obtained for an average power consumption of 45 mW. Simultaneous focusing at several locations was successfully achieved. We showed that a lumped-mass model for the fingertip can effectively describe the effect of an actual fingertip load at the focus point. Lastly, we elucidated a likely stimulation mechanism that involves the transient decoupling of the finger skin from the plate surface. This phenomenon explains the observed tactile effect.},

abstract = {In vision, the discovery of the phenomenon of saccadic suppression of displacement has made important contributions to the understanding of the stable world problem. Here, we report a similar phenomenon in the tactile modality. When scanning a single Braille dot with two fingers of the same hand, participants were asked to decide whether the dot was stationary or whether it was displaced from one location to another. The stimulus was produced by refreshable Braille devices that have dots that can be swiftly raised and recessed. In some conditions, the dot was stationary. In others, a displacement was created by monitoring the participant's finger position and by switching the dot activation when it was not touched by either finger. The dot displacement was of either 2.5 mm or 5 mm. We found that in certain cases, displaced dots were felt to be stationary. If the displacement was orthogonal to the finger movements, tactile suppression occurred effectively when it was of 2.5 mm, but when the displacement was of 5 mm, the participants easily detected it. If the displacement was medial-lateral, the suppression effect occurred as well, but less often when the apparent movement of the dot opposed the movement of the finger. In such cases, the stimulus appeared sooner than when the brain could predict it from finger movement, supporting a predictive rather than a postdictive differential processing hypothesis.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that voluntary motor activity decreases the ability to detect near-threshold electrical stimuli applied to the skin, but has no effect on the perception of either suprathreshold electrical stimuli or natural thermal stimuli (warmth, heat pain). The present study was undertaken to determine if the perception of natural tactile stimuli (vibrotactile) is diminished by motor activity (rhythmical isometric flexions and extensions about the elbow). The stimuli were applied at three different sites on the operant arm--ventral forearm, thenar eminence and distal digit--to examine also the influence of the proximity of the stimulated site to the active muscles on perception. The ability to detect near-threshold stimuli at the two more proximal stimulation sites was significantly reduced during the motor task, and these effects were more pronounced and widespread with higher levels of target force (20 N vs 50 N). Discrimination of small differences in the intensity of suprathreshold stimuli, at all three sites, was unchanged during the motor task. Finally, the subjective intensity of suprathreshold vibrotactile stimuli was reduced, in a nonlinear fashion, during the motor task; proximity again influenced the degree of modulation. In contrast a previous study showed no change in magnitude estimates of suprathreshold electrical stimuli during isotonic flexion and extension. Some possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. In addition, our previous suggestion that movement produces a simple reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio (i.e. the gating signal modelled as a masking stimulus) cannot explain the present results, so more complex models are required.},

abstract = {Masked and quiet thresholds at several frequencies of vibratory stimuli were measured as a function of contactor area. The test site was the left index finger; the masking site was the left little finger. The quiet threshold data were consistent with previous investigations: Low-frequency stimuli showed no spatial summation, whereas high-frequency stimuli did. In the presence of a masker, spatial summation was reduced or eliminated for high-frequency stimuli, i.e., the masked threshold was, under some conditions, independent of contactor area. Low-frequency stimuli continued to show no spatial summation in the presence of a masker. The attenuation of spatial summation appears to be a direct function of the intensity of the masking stimulus. Additional measurements with the left thenar eminence as the test site showed that spatial summation could be attenuated by a masker placed on a contralateral body site. The implications of the results for quantifying the effectiveness of a masking stimulus, for the duplex mechanoreceptor hypothesis, and for the nature of spatial summation on the skin are discussed.},

abstract = {The present study was set up to examine the contribution of Ia afferent input in the generation of electromyographic (EMG) activity. Subjects walked blindfolded along a walkway while tendon vibration was applied continuously to a leg muscle. The effects of vibration were measured on mean EMG activity in stance and swing phase. The results show that vibration of the quadriceps femoris (Q) at the knee and of biceps femoris (BF) at the knee enhanced the EMG activity of these muscles and this occurred mainly in the stance phase of walking. These results suggest involvement of Ia afferent input of Q and BF in EMG activation during stance. In contrast, vibration of muscles at the ankle and hip had no significant effect on burst amplitude. Additionally, the onset time of tibialis anterior was measured to look at timing of phase transitions. Only vibration of quadriceps femoris resulted in an earlier onset of tibialis anterior within the gait cycle, suggesting involvement of these Ia afferents in the triggering of phase transitions. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest involvement of Ia afferent input in the control of muscle activity during locomotion in humans. A limited role in timing of phase transitions is proposed as well.},

@article{HowardRimell:phModMusicTactile,
abstract = {Electronic sound synthesis continues to offer huge potential possibilities for the creation of new musical instruments. The traditional approach is, however, seriously limited in that it incorporates only auditory feedback and it will typically make use of a sound synthesis model (e.g., additive, subtractive, wavetable, and sampling) that is inherently limited and very often nonintuitive to the musician. In a direct attempt to challenge these issues, this paper describes a system that provides tactile as well as acoustic feedback, with real-time synthesis that invokes a more intuitive response from players since it is based upon mass-spring physical modelling. Virtual instruments are set up via a graphical user interface in terms of the physical properties of basic well-understood sounding objects such as strings, membranes, and solids. These can be interconnected to form complex integrated structures. Acoustic excitation can be applied at any point mass via virtual bowing, plucking, striking, specified waveform, or from any external sound source. Virtual microphones can be placed at any point masses to deliver the acoustic output. These aspects of the instrument are described along with the nature of the resulting acoustic output.},

In an experiment four vibration levels were presented to eleven pianists playing on a digital grand piano with grand piano-like key action. By evaluating the players' judgment of the instrument quality, strong integration effects of auditory and tactile information were observed. Differences in the sound of the instrument were perceived by the players, when the vibration level in the keys was changed and the results indicate a sound-dependent optimum of the vibration levels. By analyzing the influence of the vibration levels on the timing and dynamics accuracy of the pianists' musical performances, we could not observe systematic differences that depend on the vibration level.},

abstract = {Tactile feedback enhances the usability and enjoyment of human-computer interfaces. Many feedback techniques have been devised to present tactile stimuli corresponding to a user's hand movements taking account of the concept of active touch. However, hand movements may not necessarily be required for achieving natural tactile feedback. Here, we propose a virtual-active-touch method that achieves haptic perception without actual/direct hand movements. In this method, a cursor manipulated by a force-input device is regarded as a virtual finger of the operator on the screen. Tactile feedback is provided to the operator in accordance with cursor movements. To validate the translation of virtual roughness gratings, we compare the virtual-active-touch interface with an interface that involves actual hand movements. By using the appropriate force-to-velocity gain for the pointing-stick interface, we show that the virtual-active-touch method presents the surface wavelengths of the gratings, which is a fundamental property for texture roughness, and that the gain significantly influences the textures experienced by the operators. Furthermore, we find that the perceived wavelengths of objects scaled and viewed on a small screen are skewed. We conclude that although some unique problems remain to be solved, we may be able to perceive the surface wavelengths solely with the intentions of active touch through virtual-active-touch interfaces.},

The results indicated that none of the three haptic devices we tested were able to render perceptually distortion-free, periodically regular vibrations at detection threshold levels. Further investigation into the electrical and mechanical device properties that limited the performance of these devices revealed that D/A resolution, amplifier non-linearity and stiction were the primary sources of signal corruption.},

abstract = {For cochlear implant users, combined electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS) significantly improves the performance. However, there are many more users who do not have any functional residual acoustic hearing at low frequencies. Because tactile sensation also operates in the same low frequencies ({\textless}500 Hz) as the acoustic hearing in EAS, we propose electro-tactile stimulation (ETS) to improve cochlear implant performance. In ten cochlear implant users, a tactile aid was applied to the index finger that converted voice fundamental frequency into tactile vibrations. Speech recognition in noise was compared for cochlear implants alone and for the bimodal ETS condition. On average, ETS improved speech reception thresholds by 2.2 dB over cochlear implants alone. Nine of the ten subjects showed a positive ETS effect ranging from 0.3 to 7.0 dB, which was similar to the amount of the previously-reported EAS benefit. The comparable results indicate similar neural mechanisms that underlie both the ETS and EAS effects. The positive results suggest that the complementary auditory and tactile modes also be used to enhance performance for normal hearing listeners and automatic speech recognition for machines.},

abstract = {Wearability will significantly increase the use of haptics in everyday life, as has already happened for audio and video technologies. The literature on wearable haptics is mainly focused on vibrotactile stimulation, and only recently, wearable devices conveying richer stimuli, like force vectors, have been proposed. This paper introduces design guidelines for wearable haptics and presents a novel 3-DoF wearable haptic interface able to apply force vectors directly to the fingertip. It consists of two platforms: a static one, placed on the back of the finger, and a mobile one, responsible for applying forces at the finger pad. The structure of the device resembles that of parallel robots, where the fingertip is placed in between the static and the moving platforms. This work presents the design of the wearable display, along with the quasi-static modeling of the relationship between the applied forces and the platform's orientation and displacement. The device can exert up to 1.5 N, with a maximum platform inclination of 30 degree. To validate the device and verify its effectiveness, a curvature discrimination experiment was carried out: employing the wearable device together with a popular haptic interface improved the performance with respect of employing the haptic interface alone.},

Musicians were asked to identify the type of touch of the recorded samples, in a first block with all attack noises before the tone onsets included, in a second block without them. Half of the listeners could correctly identify significantly more tones than chance in the first block (up to 86{\%} accuracy), but no one in block 2. Those who heard no difference tended to give struck ratings for louder tones in both blocks.},

Despite repeated confirmation of anatomical and structural changes in visual, tactile, and auditory regions, significant changes have only been reported in the audiovisual domain and for the detection of audio-tactile incongruencies. In the present study, we aim at testing whether long-term musical training might also enhance other multisensory processes at a behavioural level. An audio-tactile reaction time task was administrated to a group of musicians and non-musicians. We found significantly faster reaction times with musicians for auditory, tactile, and audio-tactile stimulations. Statistical analyses between the combined uni- and multisensory reaction times revealed that musicians possess a statistical advantage when responding to multisensory stimuli compared to non-musicians. These results suggest for the first time that long-term musical training reduces simple non-musical auditory, tactile, and multisensory reaction times. Taken together with the previous results from other sensory modalities, these results strongly point towards musicians being better at integrating the inputs from various senses.},

It is crucial to determine the vibro-tactile sensitivity threshold response to acute conditions to explore innovative monitor tools and interventions to prevent and treat this challenge. The aims were: 1) to analyze the acute effects of a single whole body vibration session (4min-18Hz-4mm) on vibro-tactile perception threshold in healthy young adults. 2) to analyze the 48 hours effects of 3 whole body vibration sessions on vibro-tactile perception threshold in healthy young adults. METHODS A randomized controlled clinical trial over 3 sessions of whole body vibration intervention or 3 sessions of placebo intervention. Twenty-eight healthy young adults were included: 11 experimental group and 12 placebo group. The experimental group performed 3 sessions of WBV while the placebo group performed 3 sessions of placebo intervention. RESULTS The vibro-tactile threshold increased right after a single WBV session in comparison with placebo. Nevertheless, after 3 whole body vibration sessions and 48 hours, the threshold decreased to values lower than the initial. CONCLUSIONS The acute response of the vibro-tactile threshold to one whole body vibration session increased, but the 48 hours short-term response of this threshold decreased in healthy young adults.},

In most of the systems developed so far, these two parameters have been chosen by trial and error or by trying to match the tactor density to the spatial resolution in the human fingertip. The objective of this work is to study the effect of tactor spacing and array size on the tactile arrays performance by measuring human tactile discrimination ability. Psychophysical experiments were performed to obtain the differential threshold for discrimination of a ridge angle and the shape recognition performance while exploring edge-based patterns. The patterns were explored through different passive (nonactuated) tactile arrays of vertically moving pins and also directly with the finger. Results indicate that a tactile array of 1.8 mm tactor spacing and 1 cm2 array size transmits the pattern information with a good level of accuracy. This work shows that tactile devices with low complexity (small number of tactors) are still effective in conveying tactile cues. Moreover, this work provides performance measures that determinate the capabilities of tactile pin arrays to convey accurately tactile information.},

abstract = {There is a small but growing literature on the perception of natural acoustic events, but few attempts have been made to investigate complex sounds not systematically controlled within a laboratory setting. The present study investigates listeners' ability to make judgments about the posture (upright-stooped) of the walker who generated acoustic stimuli contrasted on each trial. We use a comprehensive three-stage approach to event perception, in which we develop a solid understanding of the source event and its sound properties, as well as the relationships between these two event stages. Developing this understanding helps both to identify the limitations of common statistical procedures and to develop effective new procedures for investigating not only the two information stages above, but also the decision strategies employed by listeners in making source judgments from sound. The result is a comprehensive, ultimately logical, but not necessarily expected picture of both the source-sound-perception loop and the utility of alternative research tools.},

abstract = {We argue that audio-tactile interactions during vibrotactile processing provide a promising, albeit largely neglected, benchmark for the systematic study multisensory integration. This article reviews and discusses current evidence for multisensory contributions to the perception of vibratory events, and proposes a framework to address a number of relevant questions. First, we highlight some of the features that characterize the senses of hearing and touch in terms of vibratory information processing, and which allow for potential cross-modal interactions at multiple levels along the functional architecture of the sensory systems. Second, we briefly review empirical evidence for interactions between hearing and touch in the domain of vibroactile perception and related stimulus properties, covering behavioural, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies in humans and animals. Third, we discuss the vibrotactile discrimination task, which has been successfully applied in the study of perception and decision processes in psychophysical and physiological research. We argue that this approach, complemented with computational modeling using biophysically realistic neural networks, may be a convenient framework to address auditory contributions to vibrotactile processing in the somatosensory system. Finally, we comment on a series of particular issues which are relevant in multisensory research and potentially addressable within the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Attempts to quantify the differences between “good” and “bad” instruments from vibrational measurements and/or listening tests have largely been inconclusive. The qualities of a violin depend upon a number of different, often subtle factors. Most of them are mechanical-acoustical, referring to the way the instrument vibrates and radiates sound. However, there are other, perceptual factors that relate to the way the player “feels” the instrument. The overall goal of this study is to better understand how violinists perceptually assess violins. This is a critical aspect of violin acoustics that has only recently been considered essential in developing an understanding of what distinguishes one instrument from another. As a starting point, we need to know how consistent players are at assessing violins and whether there is agreement between violinists.},

abstract = {The integration of information from different sensory modalities has many advantages for human observers, including increase of salience, resolution of perceptual ambiguities, and unified perception of objects and surroundings. Several behavioral, electrophysiological and neuroimaging data collected in various tasks, including localization and detection of spatial events, crossmodal perception of object properties and scene analysis are reviewed here. All the results highlight the multiple faces of crossmodal interactions and provide converging evidence that the brain takes advantages of spatial and temporal coincidence between spatial events in the crossmodal binding of spatial features gathered through different modalities. Furthermore, the elaboration of a multimodal percept appears to be based on an adaptive combination of the contribution of each modality, according to the intrinsic reliability of sensory cue, which itself depends on the task at hand and the kind of perceptual cues involved in sensory processing. Computational models based on bayesian sensory estimation provide valuable explanations of the way perceptual system could perform such crossmodal integration. Recent anatomical evidence suggest that crossmodal interactions affect early stages of sensory processing, and could be mediated through a dynamic recurrent network involving backprojections from multimodal areas as well as lateral connections that can modulate the activity of primary sensory cortices, though future behavioral and neurophysiological studies should allow a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Previous experiments performed on monkey and human fingertips suggested that the skin surface and stimulus probe decouple for sinusoidal displacements applied perpendicularly to the skin surface. From these observations, it was concluded that sinusoidal vibration may not be a suitable stimulus for understanding and modeling the tactile system. We repeated these experiments on human observers using stimulus frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 240 Hz and with displacement amplitudes up to 1 mm peak-to-peak (p-p). The skin and probe movements were measured in the steady-state using stroboscopic illumination and video microscopy. Contrary to previous conclusions, we found that decoupling did not occur for amplitudes less then 0.25 mm p-p, regardless of stimulus frequency. Decoupling was only observed for stimulus amplitudes greater than 0.25 mm over the stimulus-frequency range investigated. To further investigate this effect, a modified stimulus contactor was used, which permitted the measurement of the skin's movement using reflected light. Measurements were made on both the index fingertip and the thenar eminence. Regardless of body site, no decoupling between the skin and stimulus probe was observed for frequencies ranging from 20 to 100 Hz up to displacements of 0.25 mm p-p. These levels are well within the range used in most human psychophysical experiments performed on these parts of the body. We conclude that sinusoidal vibration can be used reliably to stimulate the tactile system and is an appropriate stimulus for developing models of touch.},

abstract = {Musical training involves exposure to complex auditory and visual stimuli, memorization of elaborate sequences, and extensive motor rehearsal. It has been hypothesized that such multifaceted training may be associated with differences in basic cognitive functions, such as prediction, potentially translating to a facilitation in expert musicians. Moreover, such differences might generalize to non-auditory stimuli. This study was designed to test both hypotheses. We implemented a cross-modal attentional cueing task with auditory and visual stimuli, where a target was preceded by compatible or incompatible cues in mainly compatible (80{\%} compatible, predictable) or random blocks (50{\%} compatible, unpredictable). This allowed for the testing of prediction skills in musicians and controls. Musicians showed increased sensitivity to the statistical structure of the block, expressed as advantage for compatible trials (disadvantage for incompatible trials), but only in the mainly compatible (predictable) blocks. Controls did not show this pattern. The effect held within modalities (auditory, visual), across modalities, and when controlling for short-term memory capacity. These results reveal a striking enhancement in cross-modal prediction in musicians in a very basic cognitive task.},

abstract = {Maximum isometric finger-grip forces were predicted using a biomechanical model for plane motion of the middle finger. In the course of this study, mathematical representations of tendon displacement, the moment arm of tendon at the finger joints and muscle force-length relationship were investigated. The information gathered was applied to the model to estimate the maximum grip force of the middle finger gripping cylinders of different sizes. Muscle force per unit physiological cross-section area of 30 N/cm2 resulted in good agreement with measured force. However, for finger postures having an acute proximal interphalangeal joint angle, the estimated force was greater than that measured. Various joint angles were applied to the model to simulate the wrist and finger postures not limited to the cylinder grip. In general the finger force was greatest with the wrist in its extended position and at acute flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The maximum finger force occurred at reduced metacarpophalangeal joint angles as the wrist joint changed from an extended position to a flexed one. It is also postulated that muscle force-length relationship is an important factor in muscle force predictions. The data obtained by this research are useful for the design of handles and the current model is applicable to the analysis of hand postures for workers using hand tools.},

However, in "real life", the ultimate judge for sounds is the human hearing system. A customer evaluates the sound of a product by his or her hearing system, not by physical measurement tools, whatever their sophistication may be. In this situation, psychoacoustics is the scientific field of choice to bridge the gap between physical and subjective evaluations. In psychoacoustic experiments, firm relations between the physical representations of sounds and the correlated hearing sensations are established. In practical applications of psychoacoustics, two main tasks can be distinguished: First, questions of sound evaluation, usually for already existing sounds which often have to be improved and Second, questions of sound quality engineering, where for a (new or modified) product or application a suitable sound has to be "tailored". For the evaluation of sounds, basic psychoacoustic magnitudes like loudness and sharpness have proven successful, which assess volume or power and tone color of sounds, respectively. Using these descriptors, extremely different questions like the quality of piano sounds or the annoyance of snoring sounds can be assessed. In addition, psychoacoustic magnitudes related to the temporal structure of sounds like fluctuation strength or roughness can play an important part. In sound quality engineering, for each sound, the right "recipe" has to be found, how to mix the different hearing sensations, to arrive at the desired sound. For the example of warning signals, a systematic approach, incorporating elements of decision tree studies, is discussed.},

Also, changing contactor force can shift the exponent of the vibrotactile magnitude function. Some discussion is given of the questions raised by the present research, in particular the question of whether static conditions modify not only the mechanics of wave propagation, but also the excitability of neural systems in the tissues.},

This relationship goes beyond a convenient coupling that is optimized for sound production. Every musical instrument defines ways in which to be touched, felt, activated. Music performance is dependent on bodily involvement that goes beyond the auditory and the sense of hearing. This article investigates the role of haptic sensation in the context of the performer–instrument relationship and draws on the writings of Georges Bataille to illuminate a discussion of the erotic in performance.},

abstract = {Materials for the vehicle interior are of specific interest to the customer. They are not only needed to fulfil technical functions, but are in direct focus of the customer's perception. The perceived quality is a function of all sensory data collected by the human perceptual system: Surfaces express design intent and craftsmanship by their visual appearance. Haptic features supervene when materials are touched. And even smell has an influence on the perception of ambience. Although sound is generated nearly every time when fingers slide across the surface, touch sounds have been disregarded so far. In order to address this issue, a method has been developed for standardized generation of touch sounds. It includes simulation of realistic finger force, touch area and sliding velocity. Sounds generated on typical flat specimen of steering wheel materials have been recorded. Sounds were played back to participants under exclusive auditory conditions. The influence of psycho-physical parameters and iconic sound features on perceived quality has been investigated. Furthermore, the interaction of sound sensation with visual and haptic features could be studied. Results demonstrate that the sound excited by fingers sliding across a surface contains essential information about the nature and the quality of materials applied. As an example, the auditory roughness can modify the perceived haptic roughness of a surface. A consequent consideration of surface touch sounds enables choice of materials with maximized multi-sensory harmony.},

abstract = {Stability and performance during rhythmic motor behaviors such as locomotion are critical for survival across taxa: falling down would bode well for neither cheetah nor gazelle. Little is known about how haptic feedback, particularly during discrete events such as the heel-strike event during walking, enhances rhythmic behavior. To determine the effect of haptic cues on rhythmic motor performance, we investigated a virtual paddle juggling behavior, analogous to bouncing a table tennis ball on a paddle. Here, we show that a force impulse to the hand at the moment of ball-paddle collision categorically improves performance over visual feedback alone, not by regulating the rate of convergence to steady state (e.g., via higher gain feedback or modifying the steady-state hand motion), but rather by reducing cycle-to-cycle variability. This suggests that the timing and state cues afforded by haptic feedback decrease the nervous system's uncertainty of the state of the ball to enable more accurate control but that the feedback gain itself is unaltered. This decrease in variability leads to a substantial increase in the mean first passage time, a measure of the long-term metastability of a stochastic dynamical system. Rhythmic tasks such as locomotion and juggling involve intermittent contact with the environment (i.e., hybrid transitions), and the timing of such transitions is generally easy to sense via haptic feedback. This timing information may improve metastability, equating to less frequent falls or other failures depending on the task.},

abstract = {Human superior temporal sulcus (STS) is thought to be a key brain area for multisensory integration. Many neuroimaging studies have reported integration of auditory and visual information in STS but less is known about the role of STS in integrating other sensory modalities. In macaque STS, the superior temporal polysensory area (STP) responds to somatosensory, auditory and visual stimulation. To determine if human STS contains a similar area, we measured brain responses to somatosensory, auditory and visual stimuli using blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI). An area in human posterior STS, STSms (multisensory), responded to stimulation in all three modalities. STSms responded during both active and passive presentation of unisensory somatosensory stimuli and showed larger responses for more intense vs. less intense tactile stimuli, hand vs. foot, and contralateral vs. ipsilateral tactile stimulation. STSms showed responses of similar magnitude for unisensory tactile and auditory stimulation, with an enhanced response to simultaneous auditory-tactile stimulation. We conclude that STSms is important for integrating information from the somatosensory as well as the auditory and visual modalities, and could be the human homolog of macaque STP.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that in tasks requiring participants to report the direction of apparent motion, task-irrelevant mono-beeps can "capture" visual motion perception when the beeps occur temporally close to the visual stimuli. However, the contributions of the relative timing of multimodal events and the event structure, modulating uni- and/or crossmodal perceptual grouping, remain unclear. To examine this question and extend the investigation to the tactile modality, the current experiments presented tactile two-tap apparent-motion streams, with an SOA of 400 ms between successive, left-/right-hand middle-finger taps, accompanied by task-irrelevant, non-spatial auditory stimuli. The streams were shown for 90 seconds, and participants' task was to continuously report the perceived (left- or rightward) direction of tactile motion. In Experiment 1, each tactile stimulus was paired with an auditory beep, though odd-numbered taps were paired with an asynchronous beep, with audiotactile SOAs ranging from -75 ms to 75 ms. Perceived direction of tactile motion varied systematically with audiotactile SOA, indicative of a temporal-capture effect. In Experiment 2, two audiotactile SOAs--one short (75 ms), one long (325 ms)--were compared. The long-SOA condition preserved the crossmodal event structure (so the temporal-capture dynamics should have been similar to that in Experiment 1), but both beeps now occurred temporally close to the taps on one side (even-numbered taps). The two SOAs were found to produce opposite modulations of apparent motion, indicative of an influence of crossmodal grouping. In Experiment 3, only odd-numbered, but not even-numbered, taps were paired with auditory beeps. This abolished the temporal-capture effect and, instead, a dominant percept of apparent motion from the audiotactile side to the tactile-only side was observed independently of the SOA variation. These findings suggest that asymmetric crossmodal grouping leads to an attentional modulation of apparent motion, which inhibits crossmodal temporal-capture effects.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile perception thresholds (VPT) at seven test frequencies (8-500 Hz) have been measured and evaluated among 170 male employees at a heavy engineering production workshop, 125 of them were at present, or in the past, exposed to hand-arm vibration. All participants were examined by a physician and none had symptoms of diseases or were exposed to other factors known to cause sensory neuropathies. VPTs [for the three lowest (8-32 Hz; non-Pacinian), for the four highest (63-500 Hz; Pacinian) and for all test frequencies together] and a sensitivity index (SI) has been individually graded in four (normal, slightly deteriorated, deteriorated and seriously deteriorated) and two (normal, abnormal) stages, respectively, and put in relation to individual exposure of vibration. The results do not show any clear relationship on an individual basis between vibration exposure and degraded vibrotactile perception. On a group basis, however, there is a clear tendency towards detoriorated VPTs when the study group is divided in exposure categories. The detorioration is most pronounced in the frequency range mediated by Pacinian corpuscles. In this range an approximately four-fold increase of relative risk for elevated VPT for those in the highest exposure category was observed compared to the non-exposed group. Corresponding relative risk estimate for SI is about 6. Therefore, the results suggest an existence of an exposure-response relationship.},

Despite the variety of subjective impressions elicited by the different feedback conditions, we found that only nonvisual feedback induced significant variations in trajectories and an increase in movement time. In a post-experiment, using a paper-and-wood physical realization of the same texture, we recorded a variety of gestural behaviors markedly different from those found with the virtual texture.

Haptic stimuli were presented via the PHANToM; visual stimuli were presented via computer monitor. The virtual surfaces were sinusoidal gratings that varied in spatial period across trials. Overall, results suggested that threshold was determined by haptic input at low surface amplitudes, and by visual input at high surface amplitudes. At intermediate amplitude values, it appeared that observers were combining information across modalities to produce a percept in the combined condition that was better than that obtained under either single modality condition.},

We investigated whether temporal recalibration would also occur between auditory and tactile stimuli. Participants were exposed to streams of brief auditory and tactile stimuli presented in synchrony, or else with the auditory stimulus leading by 75ms. After the exposure phase, the participants made temporal order judgments regarding pairs of auditory and tactile events occurring at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. The results showed that the minimal interval necessary to correctly resolve audiotactile temporal order was larger after exposure to the desynchronized streams than after exposure to the synchronous streams.

abstract = {1. Subjects without any previous experience in a tactile psychophysics task participated in a study of tactile letter recognition employing active and passive touch. In the active task, subjects reached through a curtain and examined embossed letters with horizontal, unidirectional finger strokes. In the passive task, subjects sat with their arms and hands immobilized while a rotating drum stimulator pressed the embossed letters onto the right index finger. The stimulus conditions in the passive task were identical to those used in neurophysiological experiments with monkeys. 2. A survey of 40 naive subjects who were not screened in any way showed a wide range of performance levels. There was no difference between the subjects in the active and passive tasks, either in overall mean percent correct scores, which were 49.0 and 50.7{\%}, respectively or in the percent correct scores for individual letters whose product-moment correlation coefficient was 0.94. The active and passive groups, which contained 25 and 15 members, respectively, had no members in common. 3. Videotapes of the finger movements of eight subjects in the active task showed a characteristic V-shaped velocity profile (velocity vs. lateral position) starting at approximately 100 mm/s at the left-hand edge of the plate containing the embossed letter, decelerating to a minimum when the center of the finger was directly over the letter, and then accelerating away from the letter. The average minimum scanning velocity was 17 mm/s. 4. Scanning velocity had no significant effect on performance in the passive task between 20 and 40 mm/s. An increase to 80 mm/s produced a 16{\%} decline in percent correct identifications. 5. Learning effects were evident across sessions even though subjects were given no feedback or training. The increase in mean percent correct judgments averaged 4{\%} per session, which lasted for approximately 1 h. 6. Data from 64 subjects were pooled for detailed comparison of identification patterns in active and passive touch. The results were analyzed and found to be consistent with the hypothesis that the identification and confusion probabilities are identical in the two modes. We conclude that there is no difference between active and passive touch in form recognition when the stimulus pattern is smaller than a finger pad. 7. Data from all experiments were pooled to produce a single confusion matrix with 324 presentations per letter. The majority of erroneous responses are grouped in a small number of confusion pairs and the majority of those confusion pairs are strongly asymmetric. The probable neural mechanisms of some confusion patterns are discussed.},

@article{Skedung2013,
abstract = {The human finger is exquisitely sensitive in perceiving different materials, but the question remains as to what length scales are capable of being distinguished in active touch. We combine material science with psychophysics to manufacture and haptically explore a series of topographically patterned surfaces of controlled wavelength, but identical chemistry. Strain-induced surface wrinkling and subsequent templating produced 16 surfaces with wrinkle wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 90 mmand amplitudes between 7 nmand 4.5 mm. Perceived similarities of these surfaces (and two blanks) were pairwise scaled by participants, and interdistances among all stimuli were determined by individual differences scaling (INDSCAL). The tactile space thus generated and its two perceptual dimensions were directly linked to surface physical properties – the finger friction coefficient and the wrinkle wavelength. Finally, the lowest amplitude of the wrinkles so distinguished was approximately 10 nm, demonstrating that human tactile discrimination extends to the nanoscale.},

The system is composed of 10 vibrotactile actuators placed on different positions of the body as well as an extended and modified version of a software tool for generating tactile events, the Fast Afferent/Slow Afferent (FA/SA) application. We carried out initial tests of the system in the context of enhancing the learning process of novice guitar players. In these tests we asked the performers to play the guitar part over a drum and bass-line base track, either heard or felt by the performers through headphones and the tactile display they were wearing. Results show that it is possible to accurately render the representation of the audio track in the tactile channel only, therefore reducing the cognitive load in the auditory channel.},

@article{Winter2008,
abstract = {Tactile stimulation usually occurs as a combination of an active movement (reaching out to touch a surface) and a sensation (actually feeling the surface against the skin). The brain has information about the active component (the motor command) before it occurs because of efference copy, while the passive component must be transduced before it can be processed. Since the active and passive tactile components are available to the brain at different times, determining the time of touch requires calculation worked backwards from the passive sensation, and/or worked forward from the active motor command. In order to determine which touch process is perceived more quickly, we varied the relative delay between an active and a passive touch signal and determined the relative time percieved as simultaneous. A passive touch needed to be presented before an active key was pressed in order for the two touches to be perceived as simultaneous, but this timing difference was not significant. In order to test the plasticity of the active and passive touch systems, we exploited the fact that the point of subjective simultaneity between two stimuli can sometimes be altered by repeated exposure to asynchronous presentation. We exposed subjects to an active key press/ passive touch pair delayed by 250 ms. This exposure increased the range of relative delays between active and passive touches at which the pairs were judged as simultaneous. This is consistent with an adaptive change in the processing of active touch. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Prolonged exposure of the hand to tool-induced vibrations is associated with the occurrence of conditions such as vibration white finger. This study involves the development of a new artificial model that approximates both loading and vibration behaviour of the human finger. The layered system uses polypropylene “bones”, encased in a cylinder of low modulus, room-temperature curing silicone gel (to replicate subcutaneous tissues), with an outer layer of latex (to replicate the dermis and epidermis). A protocol for manufacture was developed and dynamic mechanical analysis was carried out on a range of gels in order to choose a range close to the mechanical properties of the human finger. The load-deflection behaviour under quasi-static loading was obtained using an indenter. The indentation measurements were then compared with a set of validation data obtained from human participant testing under the same conditions. A 2-D FE model of the finger was also used to assess vibration responses using existing parameters for a human finger and those obtained from the tested materials. Vibration analysis was conducted under swept sinusoidal excitations ranging from 10 to 400 Hz whilst the FE finger model was pressed 6 mm toward the handle. Results were found to compare well. This synthetic test-bed and protocol can now be used in future experiments for assessing finger-transmitted vibrations. For instance, it can aid in assessing anti-vibration glove materials without the need for human subjects and provide consistent control of test parameters such as grip force.},

While there is the difference among individuals, it is well known that the threshold to vibration sensitivity as a function of frequency yields a U-shaped curve that reaches a maximum of sensitivity in the region of 250 Hz as shown in Fig.1. By focusing on this fact, we can evaluate which the vibration sensitivity is changed under the normal condition and the harder skin conditions caused by pressing the proximal phalange of finger forcibly. Through measuring the vibration sensitivity by the psychophysical method, we found that the vibration sensitivity at the frequency of 80 Hz and 120 Hz improves with the statistical significance test (p-value) of below 10 {\%}, but no effect was showed at the frequency of 10 Hz and 30 Hz.},

abstract = {Movement sequences such as typing or tapping display important interactions among finger movements arising from anticipatory motion (preparing for upcoming events) and coupling (non-independence among fingers). We examined pianists' finger tapping for the influence of cognitive chunking processes and biomechanical coupling constraints. In a synchronization-continuation task, pianists repeatedly tapped four-finger sequences that differed in terms of the chunks that formed subsequences and in the transitions among physically adjacent or non-adjacent fingers. Chunking influenced intertap intervals, regardless of the particular fingers tapped; the final tap of each chunk was lengthened and less variable relative to other taps. The particular fingers tapped influenced peak finger heights, consistency of motion, and velocity-acceleration patterns, regardless of chunking. Thus, cognitive constraints influenced timing, whereas biomechanical factors influenced motion trajectories. These findings provide an important caveat for study of anticipatory motion by documenting the influence of biomechanical coupling on motion trajectories.},

The vibrational com- plexity of the violin, where interior air modes vie with corpus and vibro-acoustically coupled modes to produce the actual sound, is entangled with the transformation of vibrational energy into acoustic energy to produce sound. To date no quantitative technique has been successful in reliably de- scribing or predicting the overall quality of the violin. Con- sequently as experimental techniques have evolved, scien- tific research has also. The current technology can now offer automation, low-damping support fixtures to separate out radiation damping, zero-mass-loading excitation and re- sponse, and simultaneous modal and acoustical analysis on the violin.},

abstract = {In our daily lives, we usually perceive an event via more than one sensory modality (e.g., vision, hearing, touch). Therefore, multimodal integration and interactions play an important role when we use objects and for event recognition in our environment. A virtual environment (VE) is a computer simulation of a realistic-looking and interactive world. VEs should take into account the multisensory nature of humans and communicate with the user not only through vision but also through other modalities. In addition to vision, hearing and touch are the most commonly used communication channels. Recently, a variety of products with additional tactile input and output capabilities have been developed (e.g., Apple iPhone and other touch-screen devices, NintendoWii, etc.). Some of these devices provide new possibilities for interacting with a computer, including the auditory modality. Binaural synthesis and rendering are becoming key technologies for multimedia products. Virtual environments are no longer limited to academic research; they have commercial applications, particularly in medicine, game, and entertainment industries. Thus, the quality of VEs is becoming increasingly important. User interaction with a VE is a key issue in the perception of its quality. Several studies have discussed the quality of displays, input and output devices (for different modalities) as well as software and hardware issues; however, multimodal user interaction should also be examined. This paper focuses on the parameters that influence the quality of audio-tactile VEs.},

abstract = {Grasping has been well studied in the robotics and human subjects literature, and numerous taxonomies have been developed to capture the range of grasps employed in work settings or everyday life. But how completely do these taxonomies capture grasping actions that we see every day? We asked two subjects to monitor every action that they performed with their hands during a typical day, as well as to role-play actions important for self-care, rehabilitation, and various careers and then to classify all grasping actions using existing taxonomies. While our subjects were able to classify many grasps, they also found a collection of grasps that could not be classified. In addition, our subjects observed that single entries in the taxonomy captured not one grasp, but many. When we investigated, we found that these grasps were distinguished by features related to the grasping action, such as intended motion, force, and stiffness - properties also needed for robot control. We suggest a format for augmenting grasp taxonomies that includes features of motion, force, and stiffness using a language that can be understood and expressed by subjects with light training, as would be needed, for example, for annotating examples or coaching a robot. This paper describes our study, the results, and documents our annotated database.},

The goal of the conference was to bring together an interdisciplinary group of neuroscientists, roboticists, and theorists to discuss the extent and implications of action-perception integration in the brain. The motivation for the conference was the realization that it is a widespread approach in biological, theoretical, and computational neuroscience to investigate sensory and motor function of the brain in isolation from one another, while at the same time, it is generally appreciated that sensory and motor processing cannot be fully separated. Our article summarizes the key findings of the conference, provides a hypothetical model that integrates the major themes and concepts presented at the conference, and concludes with a perspective on future challenges in the field.},

abstract = {Interaction with physical buttons is an essential part of our daily routine. We use buttons daily to turn lights on, to call an elevator, to ring a doorbell, or even to turn on our mobile devices. Buttons have distinct response characteristics and are easily activated by touch. However, there is limited tactile feedback available for their digital counterparts displayed on touchscreens. Although mobile phones incorporate low-cost vibration motors to enhance touch-based interactions, it is not possible to generate complex tactile effects on touchscreens. It is also difficult to relate the limited vibrotactile feedback generated by these motors to different types of physical buttons. In this study, we focus on creating vibrotactile feedback on a touchscreen that simulates the feeling of physical buttons using piezo actuators attached to it. We first recorded and analyzed the force, acceleration, and voltage data from twelve participants interacting with three different physical buttons: latch, toggle, and push buttons. Then, a button-specific vibrotactile stimulus was generated for each button based on the recorded data. Finally, we conducted a three-alternative forced choice (3AFC) experiment with twenty participants to explore whether the resultant stimulus is distinct and realistic. In our experiment, participants were able to match the three digital buttons with their physical counterparts with a success rate of 83{\%}. In addition, we harvested seven adjective pairs from the participants expressing their perceptual feeling of pressing the physical buttons. All twenty participants rated the degree of their subjective feelings associated with each adjective for all the physical and digital buttons investigated in this study. Our statistical analysis showed that there exist at least three adjective pairs for which participants have rated two out of three digital buttons similar to their physical counterparts.},

abstract = {Finger-pressing forces are produced by activation of the intrinsic hand muscles, which are finger specific, and the extrinsic muscles that connect to multiple fingers. We tested a hypothesis of greater weakening of intrinsic hand muscles with age and quantified associated indexes of finger interaction such as enslaving (force production by unintended fingers) and force deficit (loss of finger force in multifinger tasks compared with single-finger tasks). Twelve young (23-35 yr old) and 12 elderly (70-95 yr old) men and women performed single-finger and four-finger maximal pressing tasks, in which force was applied at the proximal phalanges (PP, the intrinsic muscles are major focal force generators) and at the distal phalanges (DP, the extrinsic muscles are focal force generators). The decline in the peak force with age was greater at PP (30{\%}) than at DP (19{\%}). Larger indexes of finger interaction were observed at PP (enslaving = 17.2 +/- 9.4{\%}, force deficit = 36.1 +/- 11.1{\%}) than at DP (enslaving = 14.9 +/- 8.8{\%}, force deficit = 27.7 +/- 10.8{\%}) across ages and genders. We conclude that intrinsic hand muscles show disproportionate weakening with age. The greater indexes of finger interaction in PP tests with greater involvement of intrinsic hand muscles suggest that the finger interactions are predominantly of a central origin across ages and genders.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the subjective and mechanical characterizations of single cane reeds. Subjective tests performed by a single expert gave an estimation of the subjective descriptors “ease of playing”, “brightness”, “roundness”, “projection” and “global quality”. The mechanical characterization involved measurements of static compliance, dynamic compliance, resonance frequency and Q factor of the first vibration mode. Two sets of clarinet reeds were studied. The first set contained 50 reeds identical in cut, brand and strength. The second set contained 150 reeds with 3 different cuts but identical in brand, strength and static compliance. Results show that the perceptual space is almost bi-dimensional for the first set of reeds and mono-dimensional for the second set. For the first set, the two dimensions were largely created by the descriptors ease of playing (highly correlated to brightness) and roundness. For the second set (with a constant static compliance), the main dimension was created by all the descriptors, that are correlated. The study of correlation coefficients between subjective descriptors and mechanical parameters shows that the static and dynamic compliance are correlated with the descriptor ease of playing for set 1. For set 2, the correlations are too low to make a link between the perceptual space and the objective parameters.},

@article{QueraltAl:auditoryStartleWalking,
abstract = {Movement execution is speeded up when a startle auditory stimulus is applied with an imperative signal in a simple reaction time task experiment, a phenomenon described as StartReact. The effect has been recently observed in a step adjustment task requiring fast selection of specific movements in a choice reaction time task. Therefore, we hypothesized that inducing a StartReact effect may be beneficial in obstacle avoidance under time pressure, when subjects have to perform fast gait adjustments. Twelve healthy young adults walked on a treadmill and obstacles were released in specific moments of the step cycle. On average the EMG onset latency in the biceps femoris shortened by 20{\%} while amplitude increased by 50{\%}, in trials in which an auditory startle accompanied obstacle avoidance. The presentation of a startle increased the probability of using a long step strategy, enlarged stride length modifications and resulted in higher success rates, to avoid the obstacle. We also examined the effects of the startle in a condition in which the obstacle was not present in comparison to a condition in which the obstacle was visibly present but it did not fall. In the latter condition, the obstacle avoidance reaction occurred with a similar latency but smaller amplitude as in trials in which the obstacle was actually released. Our results suggest that the motor programmes used for obstacle avoidance are probably stored at subcortical structures. The release of these motor programmes by a startling auditory stimulus may combine intersensory facilitation and the StartReact effect.},

abstract = {Although the human finger is the interface used for the touch process, very few studies have used its properties to provide a description of tactile perception regarding age and gender effects. Age and gender effects on the biophysical properties of the human finger were the main topics of our previous study. Correlating tactile perception with each parameter proved very complex. We expand on that work to assess the static and dynamic touch in addition to the touch gestures. We also investigate the age and gender effects on tactile perception by studying the finger size and the real contact area (static and dynamic) of forty human fingers of different ages and gender. The size of the finger and the real contact area (static and dynamic) define the density of the mechanoreceptors. This density is an image of the number of mechanoreceptors solicited and therefore of tactile perception (static and dynamic). In addition, the touch gestures used to perceive an object's properties differ among people. Therefore, we seek to comprehend the tactile perception of different touch gestures due to the anisotropy of mechanical properties, and we study two different directions (top to bottom and left to right).},

Detection (Exp. 1) and discrimination (Exp. 2) thresholds for virtual haptic gratings were estimated using a force-feedback device that simulated sinusoidal and square-wave gratings with spatial periods from 0.2 to 38.4 mm. The detection threshold results indicated that for spatial periods up to 6.4 mm (i.e., spatial frequencies {\textgreater}0.156 cycle/mm), the detectability of square-wave gratings could be predicted quantitatively from the detection thresholds of their corresponding fundamental components. The discrimination experiment confirmed that at higher spatial frequencies, the square-wave gratings were initially indistinguishable from the corresponding fundamental components until the third harmonics were detectable. At lower spatial frequencies, the third harmonic components of square-wave gratings had lower detection thresholds than the corresponding fundamental components. Therefore, the square-wave gratings were detectable as soon as the third harmonic components were detectable. Results from a third experiment where gratings consisting of two superimposed sinusoidal components were compared (Exp. 3) showed that people were insensitive to the relative phase between the two components. Our results have important implications for engineering applications, where complex haptic signals are transmitted at high update rates over networks with limited bandwidths.},

abstract = {We report two psychophysical experiments designed to investigate the effects of non touch-produced sounds on the tactile perception of roughness and length. Previous studies have demonstrated that the tactile roughness perception of object surfaces is modified by sounds elicited by rubbing the surfaces. In this study, we examined the crossmodal effects of non touch-produced sounds such as white noise (Experiment 1) and pure tones (Experiment 2). Participants touched abrasive paper, synchronizing their touch with changes in the intensity of sounds or with the onset of beeps (control condition), and judged the tactile roughness or length of the stimuli, using the magnitude estimation method. Although the white noise (complex sound) significantly decreased the slope of the roughness estimation function, it did not affect that of the length estimation function. Pure tones had no effect on roughness or length perception. The results revealed that complex sounds selectively affected tactile roughness perception, even when they were seemingly irrelevant to the exploration of the surfaces. We suggest that the processing of complex sounds may be related to the processing of tactile roughness, whereas it is independent of tactile length processing.},

The aims of the study were to better understand how musicians conceptualize violin quality, what aspects of the sound and the playing experience are essential, and what associations are formed between perceptual evaluation and phys-ical description. Upon comparing violins of varying make and age, players were interviewed about their preferences using open-ended questions. Concepts of violin quality were identified and cate-gorized based on the syntactic and linguistic analysis of musicians' responses. While perceived variations in how a violin sounds and feels, and consequently conceptualization structures, rely on the variations in style and expertise of different violinists, the broader semantic categories emerging from sensory descriptions remain common across performers with diverse musical profiles, reflect-ing a shared perception of physical parameter patterns that allowed the development of a musician-driven framework for understanding how the dynamic behavior of a violin might relate to its perceived quality. Implications for timbre perception and the crossmodal audio-tactile sensation of sound in music performance are discussed.},

abstract = {This chapter sets about to provide the background and orientation needed to set a novice designer on his or her way to bringing haptics successfully into an interactive product. To define appropriate roles for haptic interaction, it is necessary to integrate a basic awareness of human capabilities on one hand and current device technology on the other. Here, I explore this integration by first summarizing the most salient constraints imposed by both humans and hardware. I then proceed to relate perceptual, motor, and attentional capabilities to a selection of emerging application contexts chosen to be relevant to contemporary design trends and opportunities. These include abstract communication and notification, augmentation of graphical user interfaces, expressive control, affective communication, and mobile and handheld computing.},

Using a three-interval one-up three-down adaptive tracking procedure, detection thresholds for virtual gratings were estimated using a custom-designed high position-resolution 3-degrees-of-freedom force-feedback haptic device. Two types of gratings were used, defined by sinusoidal and square waveforms, with spatial wavelengths of 0.2 to 25.6 mm. The results indicated that the participants demonstrated a higher sensitivity (i.e., lower detection threshold) to square-wave gratings than to sinusoidal ones at all the wavelengths tested. When the square-wave gratings were represented by the explicative Fourier series, it became apparent that the detectability of the square-wave gratings could be determined by that of the sinusoidal gratings at the corresponding fundamental frequencies. This was true for any square-wave grating as long as the detection threshold for the fundamental component was below those of the harmonic components},

@article{Tomassini2014,
abstract = {The link between time perception and action has attracted special interest in recent years and it is progressively disclosing a multifaceted nature. A large set of temporal effects variously associated to the execution of actions has been documented (Haggard et al., 2002; Hagura et al., 2012; Tomassini et al., 2012; Yarrow et al., 2001), suggesting that perceived time may directly emerge from sensory-motor processes. Saccadic eye movements have been shown to cause not only compression of the visual space towards the saccadic target, but also a compression of time. Apparent event time is both shifted and compressed so that the temporal separation of two visual stimuli is strongly reduced and even their order of appearance sometimes reversed. The spatial and temporal distortions are thought to be interconnected phenomena that might be related to the problem of maintaining perceptual stability during eye movements (Burr {\&} Morrone, 2012; Cicchini et al., 2013). Interestingly, evidence suggests that similar phenomena may occur around the time of hand movements, when brief tactile stimuli are systematically mislocalized in the direction of the movement. In this study we measured whether hand movements also cause an alteration of the perceived timing of the tactile signals. Participants compared the temporal separation between two pairs of tactile taps while moving their right hand in response to an auditory cue. The first pair of tactile taps was presented at variable times with respect to movement with a fixed onset asynchrony of 150ms. 2 s after test presentation - when the hand was stationary- the second pair of taps was delivered with a variable temporal separation. Tactile stimuli could be delivered either to the right moving or left stationary hand. We found that when the tactile stimuli were presented on the motor effector, their perceived temporal separation was reduced. The compression of time began in stationary conditions, during the motor preparatory period, and persisted during movement. Critically, at the moments around action initiation, time compression was restricted to the motor effector. Duration was misjudged only when tactile stimuli were delivered to the hand that was about to move and not when delivered to the other, stationary hand. That time compression is effector-specific makes highly implausible any explanation based on high-level attentional modulations. Rather, it points to a specific mechanism based on a finely-tuned sensory-motor coupling. To understand better the nature and origin of the temporal distortion accompanying hand movements we tested also an isometric condition. Motor efference, with no associated spatial displacement of any body part, induced comparable compression of perceived time as actual movement. An intention-to-move signal, seems thus to be sufficient to mediate the observed perceptual effects. Our result corroborates recent evidence of a tight link between time perception and action and shows a selective and anticipatory movement-related distortion of time. The changes in apparent time that we observed for tactile stimuli at the moment of hand movements closely resemble the peri-saccadic distortions of visual time. As for vision, the mislocalizations of time and space of touch stimuli may be consequences of a mechanism attempting to achieve perceptual stability, suggesting that different sensorimotor systems may exploit similar strategies during the active exploration of the environment.},

@article{Zamorano2014,
abstract = {Extensive training of repetitive and highly skilled movements, as it occurs in professional classical musicians, may lead to changes in tactile sensitivity and corresponding cortical reorganization of somatosensory cortices. It is also known that professional musicians frequently experience musculoskeletal pain and pain-related symptoms during their careers. The present study aimed at understanding the complex interaction between chronic pain and music training with respect to somatosensory processing. For this purpose, tactile thresholds (mechanical detection, grating orientation, two-point discrimination) and subjective ratings to thermal and pressure pain stimuli were assessed in 17 professional musicians with chronic pain, 30 pain-free musicians, 20 non-musicians with chronic pain, and 18 pain-free non-musicians. We found that pain-free musicians displayed greater touch sensitivity (i.e., lower mechanical detection thresholds), lower tactile spatial acuity (i.e., higher grating orientation thresholds) and increased pain sensitivity to pressure and heat compared to pain-free non-musicians. Moreover, we also found that musicians and non-musicians with chronic pain presented lower tactile spatial acuity and increased pain sensitivity to pressure and heat compared to pain-free non-musicians. The significant increment of pain sensitivity together with decreased spatial discrimination in pain-free musicians and the similarity of results found in chronic pain patients, suggests that the extensive training of repetitive and highly skilled movements in classical musicians could be considered as a risk factor for developing chronic pain, probably due to use-dependent plastic changes elicited in somatosensory pathways.},

abstract = {Haptic perception essentially depends on the executed exploratory movements. It has been speculated that spontaneously executed movements are optimized for the computation of associated haptic properties. We investigated to what extent people strategically execute movements that are tuned for softness discrimination of objects with deformable surfaces. In Experiment 1, we investigated how movement parameters depend on expected stimulus compliance. In a discrimination task, we measured exploratory forces for less compliant (hard) stimuli and for more compliant (soft) stimuli. In Experiment 2, we investigated whether exploratory force also depends on the expected compliance difference between the two stimuli. The results indicate that participants apply higher forces when expecting harder objects as compared to softer objects, and they apply higher forces for smaller compliance differences than for larger ones. Experiment 3 examined how applied force influences differential sensitivity for softness as assessed by just noticeable differences (JNDs). For soft stimuli, JNDs did not depend on force. For hard stimuli, JNDs were “worse” (higher) if participants applied less force than they use naturally. We conclude that applying high force is a robust strategy to obtain high differential sensitivity, and that participants used this strategy if it was required for successful discrimination performance.},

Although our actions can modify our perceptions externally, by modifying the world or our view of it, it has recently become clear that even without this external feedback the preparation and execution of a variety of motor actions can have an effect on three-dimensional perceptual processes. Here, we review the ways in which an observer's motor actions--locomotion, head and eye movements, and object manipulation--affect his or her perception and representation of three-dimensional objects and space. Allowing observers to act can drastically change the way they perceive the third dimension, as well as how scientists view depth perception.},

Auditory stimuli were pure tones presented binaurally through headphones; tactile stimuli were sinusoids delivered through a single-channel vibrator to the left middle fingertip. All stimuli were presented together with a broadband auditory noise. The A and T stimuli were presented at levels that were matched in loudness to that of the 200-Hz auditory tone at 25 dB sensation level. The 200-Hz auditory tone was then matched in loudness to various combinations of auditory and tactile stimuli (A+T), and purely auditory stimuli (A+A). The results indicate that the matched intensity of the 200-Hz auditory tone is less when the A+T and A+A stimuli are close together in frequency than when they are separated by an octave or more. This suggests that A+T integration may operate in a manner similar to that found in auditory critical band studies, further supporting a strong frequency relationship between the auditory and somatosensory systems.},

@article{Yau2010,
abstract = {A major goal in perceptual neuroscience is to understand how signals from different sensory modalities are combined to produce stable and coherent representations. We previously investigated interactions between audition and touch, motivated by the fact that both modalities are sensitive to environmental oscillations. In our earlier study, we characterized the effect of auditory distractors on tactile frequency and intensity perception. Here, we describe the converse experiments examining the effect of tactile distractors on auditory processing. Because the two studies employ the same psychophysical paradigm, we combined their results for a comprehensive view of how auditory and tactile signals interact and how these interactions depend on the perceptual task. Together, our results show that temporal frequency representations are perceptually linked regardless of the attended modality. In contrast, audio-tactile loudness interactions depend on the attended modality: Tactile distractors influence judgments of auditory intensity, but judgments of tactile intensity are impervious to auditory distraction. Lastly, we show that audio-tactile loudness interactions depend critically on stimulus timing, while pitch interactions do not. These results reveal that auditory and tactile inputs are combined differently depending on the perceptual task. That distinct rules govern the integration of auditory and tactile signals in pitch and loudness perception implies that the two are mediated by separate neural mechanisms. These findings underscore the complexity and specificity of multisensory interactions.},

abstract = {The overall goal of the research presented here is to better understand how players evaluate different qualities of the vi- olin. To this end, we investigated intra- and inter-individual consistency in preference judgements by experienced vi- olinists. Results from two previous studies that involved free-playing evaluative tasks showed that players are self- consistent in their preference for violins and tend to agree of what particular qualities they look for in an instrument (in this case, “richness” and “dynamic range”). However, the perception of the same attributes widely varies across individuals, thus likely resulting in large inter-individual differences in the preference for violins. A third study was conducted to further investigate the perceptual eval- uation of richness and dynamic range in constrained- vs. unconstrained-playing tasks. Results indicated that specify- ing the musical material and technique removes a significant amount of inter-individual variability: the more focused the task, the more self-consistent violinists are and the more they agree with each other.},

Target stimuli were presented either in isolation (no-masker condition) or in the presence of masking stimuli (one- or two-masker conditions). Six reference target signals in the frequency range 2-300 Hz (two each from low-, medium-, and high-frequency regions) and at an amplitude of either 20 or 35 dB sensation levels (SL) were used. In the no-masker condition, the range of frequency Weber fraction was 0.13-0.38 and 0.14-0.28, and the range of amplitude discrimination threshold was 1.82-2.98 dB and 1.65-2.71 dB, at 20 and 35 dB SL, respectively. In the masking conditions, average frequency Weber fractions rose to 0.60 and 0.46, and average amplitude thresholds rose to 3.63 and 3.72 dB, at 20 and 35 dB SL, respectively. In general, thresholds were largest in the two-masker condition and lowest in the no-masker condition. Although the frequency and amplitude thresholds generally increased in the presence of masking stimuli, there was some indication of channel independence for low- and high-frequency target stimuli. The implications of the results for tactual communication of speech are discussed.},

abstract = {Background. A musical instrument is a device for producing musical tones. Therefore engineers traditionally associate the quality of the musical instrument with the quality of the tones it produces. In turn, the quality of the tone is determined by its acoustical parameters. In this deterministic logic, it is quite possible to judge the quality of the instrument by the parameters of its tones, provided the relations between them are known. From an engineering point of view the playing comfort and tone quality of a musical instrument are usually assigned to different design units of a musical instrument (e.g. key action vs. sound unit in pianos), For this reason, instrument designers like to have expert musicians' judgments of an instrument separated in acoustical and mechanical qualities. Aims. We want to show, that this separation is not reliable under normal playing conditions due to psychological reasons. Practical ways of avoiding the problem are discussed. Main contribution. Our experimental data suggest that the performer's impression of the quality of a musical instrument received simultaneously over the auditory and kinesthetic sensory channels are not additive. Cross-modal interference is a plausible explanation to why musicians confuse these impressions. Multimodal perception of a musical instrument by the performer and listener, respectively, is analyzed. Implications. 1) Improving procedures of quality assessment in musical instrument industry; 2) Solving, on a psychological level, the classical controversy between musicians and physicists of touch dependence of a piano tone.},

In Experiment 2, ten repetitions of two audiovisual incongruency conditions x nine audiovisual delays were presented to 13 drummers and 13 novices. Participants gave forced-choice judgments of audiovisual synchrony. The results of Experiment 1 show an enhancement in experts' ability to detect asynchrony, especially for slower drumming tempos. In Experiment 2 an increase in sensitivity to asynchrony was found for incongruent stimuli; this increase, however, is attributable only to the novice group. Altogether the results indicated that through musical practice we learn to ignore variations in stimulus characteristics that otherwise would affect our multisensory integration processes.},

Classes were defined by values on one dimension, or redundantly, by two or three dimensions. Response times and exploratory procedures (Lederman {\&} Klatzky, 1987) were recorded. Experiment 1 showed that a second dimension speeded responses for all combinations (redundancy gain), but a third dimension produced no further effect. In Experiments 2 and 3, classification trials began with two redundant dimensions, and subsequently one was withdrawn (held constant). When texture and hardness varied redundantly, withdrawal of either increased response time--even when subjects were initially instructed to focus on one dimension. Joint exploration for texture and hardness dominated whenever the two varied redundantly and persisted despite withdrawal. Redundancy gains (Experiment 1), but not substantial withdrawal effects (Experiments 2 and 3), were observed for combinations of texture or hardness with planar contour, indicating less integration than between substance dimensions. Compatibility of exploratory procedures appears to constrain dimensional integration.},

It is argued that the functional relationship between the intracerebral electrical activations in the auditory and premotor cortex should be rhythmically decreased and increased. To test this hypothesis, intracerebral electrical activations for the auditory and premotor cortex were estimated using scalp EEG and standardized low-resolution electrical tomography (sLORETA). The extracted times series were subjected to a Granger causality analysis, revealing a causal relationship from the auditory cortex to the premotor cortex that was considerably stronger during piano playing and weaker during rest. Importantly, this relationship varied rhythmically during the course of piano playing, with lags (obtained with cross-correlations) between 666 ms and 820 milliseconds. This study thus delivers evidence that the functional coupling between the auditory and premotor cortex varies during piano playing.},

We have determined the psychophysical function for roughness using textures rendered with a high-fidelity magnetic levitation haptic device. A constraint surface algorithm was used to simulate the motion of a spherical probe over trapezoidal gratings and randomly dithered cones. The shape of the psychophysical functions for roughness is consistent between subjects but varies with changes in texture and probe geometry. For dithered cones, inverted “U”-shaped functions were found nearly identical, in maxima and curvature, to those in the literature for real textures with similar geometry.},

abstract = {This study clarifies whether the established frequency weighting procedure for evaluating exposure to hand-transmitted vibration can effectively evaluate the temporary changes in vibrotactile perception thresholds due to pre-exposure to vibration. In addition, this study investigates the relationship between changes of the vibrotactile perception thresholds and the normalized energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration. The fingers of 10 healthy subjects, five male and five female, were exposed to vibration under 16 conditions with a combination of different frequencies, intensities, and exposure times. The vibration frequencies were 31.5 and 125 Hz and exposure lasted between 2 and 16 min. According to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 5349-1, the energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration for the experimental time of 16 min is 2.5 or 5.0 m s(-2) root-mean-square, corresponding to a 8-h equivalent acceleration, A(8), of approximately 0.5 and 0.9 m s(-2), respectively. A measure of the vibrotactile perception thresholds was conducted before the different exposures to vibration. Immediately after the vibration exposure, the acute effect was measured continuously on the exposed index finger for the first 75 s, followed by 30 s of measures every minute for a maximum of 10 min. If the subject's thresholds had not recovered, the measures continued for a maximum of 30 min with measurements taken every 5 min. Pre-exposure to vibration significantly influenced vibrotactile thresholds. This study concludes that the influence on the thresholds depends on the frequency of the vibration stimuli. Increased equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration resulted in a significant change in threshold, but the thresholds were unaffected when changes in the vibration magnitude were expressed as the frequency-weighted acceleration or the unweighted acceleration. Moreover, the frequency of the pre-vibration exposure significantly influenced (up to 25 min after exposure) recovery time of the vibrotactile thresholds. This study shows that the frequency weighting procedure in ISO 5349-1 is unable to predict the produced acute changes in the vibrotactile perception. Moreover, the results imply that the calculation of the 'energy-equivalent' frequency-weighted acceleration does not reflect the acute changes of the vibration perception thresholds due to pre-exposure to vibration. Furthermore, when testing for the vibrotactile thresholds, exposure to vibration on the day of a test might influence the results. Until further knowledge is obtained, the previous practice of 3 h avoidance of vibration exposure before assessment is recommended.},

For example, your attention might be attracted by somebody touching your hand or, if you are the one trying to attract attention, you will feel the touch contact. In everyday usage, the term does not distinguish between stimulation imposed on us and stimulation that results from our own intentional movement. In this review we consider the nature of touch. However, in our use of the term we include not only skin sensation but also proprioceptive sensation arising in sensory receptors in the muscles (the term "haptics" is sometimes used to refer to the combination of skin and muscle sensory input). We compare and contrast touch that is "passive" (when you are the recipient) and "active" (when your movement is the cause). Our purpose is twofold. First, we seek to describe current understanding of the neurophysiology of a key sensory system. Second, we wish to show how a psychological approach helps us to understand the use of touch information and, to that extent, put the neurophysiology in context.},

abstract = {Finger force, acceleration and position are fundamental in playing music instruments. Measuring these parameters is a technical challenge and precise position and acceleration measurement of single fingers is particularly demanding. We present a sensor setup for multi modal measurements of force, position and acceleration in piano playing. We capture outputs from the upper extremity contributing to the total force output seen at the fingers. To precisely char- acterize fingers' positions and acceleration we use wear- able sensors. A 6-axes (3-force and 3-torque axes) force sensor precisely captures contributions from hand, wrist and arm. A finger's acceleration sensor and a MIDI grand piano complete the measuring setup. The acceleration and position sensor is fixed to the dorsal aspect of the last fin- ger phalanx. The 6-axes sensor is adjustable to fit individ- ual hand positions and constitutes a basis setup that can be easily expanded to account for diverse measurement needs. An existing software tool was adapted to visualize the sen- sor data and to synchronize it to the MIDI out. With this basis setup we seek to estimate the isolated force output of finger effectors and to show coherences of finger position, force and attack. To proof the setup, a few pilot measure- ments were carried out.},

@article{Lindsell2003,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare vibrotactile thresholds between five international test centres, to determine causes of variability, and to provide normative data for use by health professionals. METHODS: Vibrotactile thresholds were measured on various fingers in 1,008 subjects at 31.5 Hz (2,531 measurements) and at 125 Hz (2,807 measurements). Three centres used the up-and-down method of limits, rate of change of stimulus 3dB/s, to obtain vibrotactile thresholds. The push force on the surround was 2 N, the probe contact force was 1 N and the probe diameter was 6 mm concentric to a 10-mm diameter hole in the surround. One centre used an up-and-down method of limits with a 5-dB step and a 1.26-mm diameter probe with no surround. Another centre used a stepping algorithm, no surround, and the force on the 6-mm-diameter probe was unspecified. RESULTS: The 31.5-Hz thresholds and 125-Hz thresholds, expressed in dB, were similar between centres using similar methods. There were small ({\textless}5 dB) differences in vibrotactile thresholds between male and female subjects, between white-collar and blue-collar workers and between fingers. Both 31.5-Hz and 125-Hz thresholds increased with age; the mean effect of age on 31.5-Hz thresholds was approximately 2 dB over 25 years, while the effect of age on 125 Hz-thresholds was as high as 10 dB over 25 years. CONCLUSIONS: Vibrotactile thresholds are influenced by measurement method but can be similar at different centres if similar methods are used. Effects of measurement location and gender are often negligible. Thresholds depend on age, but over the range of ages considered, only the effect on 125-Hz thresholds is sufficient for correction; methods of correcting for age are given. These normative data may be used to assist the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy involving vibrotactile sensation.},

abstract = {Practicing a musical instrument is a rich multisensory experience involving the integration of visual, auditory, and tactile inputs with motor responses. This combined psychophysics-fMRI study used the musician's brain to investigate how sensory-motor experience molds temporal binding of auditory and visual signals. Behaviorally, musicians exhibited a narrower temporal integration window than nonmusicians for music but not for speech. At the neural level, musicians showed increased audiovisual asynchrony responses and effective connectivity selectively for music in a superior temporal sulcus-premotor-cerebellar circuitry. Critically, the premotor asynchrony effects predicted musicians' perceptual sensitivity to audiovisual asynchrony. Our results suggest that piano practicing fine tunes an internal forward model mapping from action plans of piano playing onto visible finger movements and sounds. This internal forward model furnishes more precise estimates of the relative audiovisual timings and hence, stronger prediction error signals specifically for asynchronous music in a premotor-cerebellar circuitry. Our findings show intimate links between action production and audiovisual temporal binding in perception.},

Fast feed forward and feedback connections that link the acoustic target to the corresponding motor programs need to be established during years of practice. The aim of our study is to provide a detailed description of cortical structures that participate in this audio-motor coordination network in professional pianists and non-musicians. In order to map these interacting areas using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we considered cortical areas that are concurrently activated during silent piano performance and motionless listening to piano sound. Furthermore we investigated to what extent interactions between the auditory and the motor modality happen involuntarily. We observed a network of predominantly secondary and higher order areas belonging to the auditory and motor modality. The extent of activity was clearly increased by imagination of the absent modality. However, this network did neither comprise primary auditory nor primary motor areas in any condition. Activity in the lateral dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and the pre-supplementary motor cortex (preSMA) was significantly increased for pianists. Our data imply an intermodal transformation network of auditory and motor areas which is subject to a certain degree of plasticity by means of intensive training.},

If this is true, a vibrating surface should feel different from a stationary one. To test this prediction, experiments were conducted in which subjects examined two identical surfaces, one of which was surreptitiously made to vibrate, and judged which of the two was smoother. In experiment 1, the vibrating surface was less and less often judged smoother as the amplitude of (150 Hz) vibration increased. The effect was comparable in subjects who realized the surface was vibrating and those who did not. Experiment 2 showed that different frequencies (150–400 Hz) were equally effective in eliciting the effect when equated in sensation level (dB SL).

abstract = {The effects of various conditions, including temporary threshold shifts (TTS) induced by exposure to vibration on vibration sense thresholds, have been investigated. The vibration sense thresholds of five subjects were measured on the middle fingertip of the left hand. A contactor with a diameter of 7 mm was surrounded by three alternative plates with holes of different sizes. The contact force was controlled at either 1 N, 2 N, or 3 N. For the TTS test, the left hand was exposed to vibration at 20 ms-2 rms for five minutes. The frequencies of both the exposure to vibration and the vibration threshold test were in the range 16 Hz to 500 Hz. Using a surround around the contactor greatly reduced the vibration sense threshold at 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz but increased the threshold at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz. An effect of contact force was seen only at the higher frequencies; larger contact forces led to lower thresholds at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz. As temperature of the finger skin decreased, the vibration thresholds increased, with the changes at higher frequencies greater than those at lower frequencies. The TTS at 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz measured 0.5 minutes after exposure to vibration (TTS0.5) were highest after exposures to vibration at lower frequencies. The TTS0.5 at 63 Hz was similar after exposure to all frequencies. The TTS0.5 values at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz were highest after exposures to vibration at 125 Hz and 250 Hz. It was apparent that the physiological characteristics of vibration sensation at low and high frequencies differed significantly. These findings suggest that two representative frequencies can be used when evaluation the neurological effects of occupational exposures to vibration by means of vibration sense thresholds.},

abstract = {Most violinists believe that instruments by Stradivari and Guarneri "del Gesu" are tonally superior to other violins--and to new violins in particular. Many mechanical and acoustical factors have been proposed to account for this superiority; however, the fundamental premise of tonal superiority has not yet been properly investigated. Player's judgments about a Stradivari's sound may be biased by the violin's extraordinary monetary value and historical importance, but no studies designed to preclude such biasing factors have yet been published. We asked 21 experienced violinists to compare violins by Stradivari and Guarneri del Gesu with high-quality new instruments. The resulting preferences were based on the violinists' individual experiences of playing the instruments under double-blind conditions in a room with relatively dry acoustics. We found that (i) the most-preferred violin was new; (ii) the least-preferred was by Stradivari; (iii) there was scant correlation between an instrument's age and monetary value and its perceived quality; and (iv) most players seemed unable to tell whether their most-preferred instrument was new or old. These results present a striking challenge to conventional wisdom. Differences in taste among individual players, along with differences in playing qualities among individual instruments, appear more important than any general differences between new and old violins. Rather than searching for the "secret" of Stradivari, future research might best focused on how violinists evaluate instruments, on which specific playing qualities are most important to them, and on how these qualities relate to measurable attributes of the instruments, whether old or new.},

abstract = {Determining tendon tensions of the finger muscles is crucial for the understanding and the rehabilitation of hand pathologies. Since no direct measurement is possible for a large number of finger muscle tendons, biomechanical modelling presents an alternative solution to indirectly evaluate these forces. However, the main problem is that the number of muscles spanning a joint exceeds the number of degrees of freedom of the joint resulting in mathematical under-determinate problems. In the current study, a method using both numerical optimization and the intra-muscular electromyography (EMG) data was developed to estimate the middle finger tendon tensions during static fingertip force production. The method used a numerical optimization procedure with the muscle stress squared criterion to determine a solution while the EMG data of three extrinsic hand muscles serve to enforce additional inequality constraints. The results were compared with those obtained with a classical numerical optimization and a method based on EMG only. The proposed method provides satisfactory results since the tendon tension estimations respected the mechanical equilibrium of the musculoskeletal system and were concordant with the EMG distribution pattern of the subjects. These results were not observed neither with the classical numerical optimization nor with the EMG-based method. This study demonstrates that including the EMG data of the three extrinsic muscles of the middle finger as inequality constraints in an optimization process can yield relevant tendon tensions with regard to individual muscle activation patterns, particularly concerning the antagonist muscles.},

abstract = {Musician's brains constitute an interesting model for neuroplasticity. Imaging studies demonstrated that sensorimotor cortical representations are altered in musicians, which was assumed to arise from the development of skilled performance. However, the perceptual consequences of the cortical changes remain elusive. Here we ask whether cortical reorganization induced by professional musical skill training is paralleled by the evolution of other, unrelated perceptual abilities. We therefore studied psychophysically tactile spatial acuity as an indirect marker of cortical changes in professional pianists and non-musician control subjects using a simultaneous two-point discrimination paradigm. We show that long-lasting piano practising resulted in lower spatial discrimination thresholds in comparison to non-musicians. In musicians, individual discrimination thresholds were linearly correlated with the daily training duration, indicating a direct link between tactile acuity and the degree of piano practising. To investigate whether the superior acuity in pianists is subject to further improvement, we used a Hebbian stimulation protocol of tactile coactivation known to improve spatial tactile acuity. Three hours of coactivation further reduced their discrimination thresholds. The coactivation-induced gain in pianists was significantly larger in comparison to control subjects and correlated with the years of heavy daily practising ({\textgreater}3 h/day), but not with the total years including casual playing. Our results suggest that despite already high-level performance in pianists, Hebbian learning was more effective in musicians than in controls. This implies stronger capacities for plastic reorganization and points to enhanced learning abilities implicating a form of meta-plasticity in professional pianists.},

Based on the analysis, the sticky sensation was simply synthesized by using vacuum pressure.

Our tactile display is composed of two rotating ec- centric mass actuators driven by a PWM signal generated from an Arduino microcontroller. We conducted physical measurements using an accelerometer and two user-based studies in order to evaluate: intensity and spectral peak fre- quency as function of duty cycle, as well as perceptual vi- brotactile absolute and differential threshold. Results, ob- tained through the use of a logit regression model, provide us with precise design guidelines. These guidelines will enable us to ensure robust perceptual discrimination be- tween vibrotactile stimuli at different intensities. Among with other characterizations presented in this study, these guidelines will allow us to better design tactile cues for our notification system for live-electronics performance.},

abstract = {When we walk in place with our eyes closed after a few minutes of walking on a treadmill, we experience an unintentional forward body displacement (drift), called the sensory-motor aftereffect. Initially, this effect was thought to be due to the mismatch experienced during treadmill walking between the visual (absence of optic flow signaling body steadiness) and proprioceptive (muscle spindles firing signaling body displacement) information. Recently, the persistence of this effect has been shown even in the absence of vision, suggesting that other information, such as the sound of steps, could play a role. To test this hypothesis, six cochlear-implanted individuals were recruited and their forward drift was measured before (Control phase) and after (Post Exercise phase) walking on a treadmill while having their cochlear system turned on and turned off. The relevance in testing cochlear-implanted individuals was that when their system is turned off, they perceive total silence, even eliminating the sounds normally obtained from bone conduction. Results showed the absence of the aftereffect when the system was turned off, underlining the fundamental role played by sounds in the control of action and breaking new ground in the use of interactive sound feedback in motor learning and motor development.},

abstract = {Complex vibrotactile waveforms consisting of two superimposed sinusoids at varying phases were presented to the fingertip, and observers made "same-different" judgments. It was found that the low-frequency (10Hz+30Hz) waveforms were discriminable from one another while discrimination of the high-frequency (100Hz+300Hz) vibrations was poor. High-frequency adaptation did not impair discrimination of the low-frequency waveforms, suggesting that the RA channel mediated discrimination. Low-frequency adaptation impaired discrimination of the high-frequency stimuli, suggesting that the RA channel likewise mediated the modest level of performance observed in the absence of an adapting stimulus. The results indicate that this channel encodes complex waveforms temporally. A simple model for low-frequency waveform discrimination is proposed. The results obtained with the high-frequency complex waveforms are compatible with the hypothesis that the PC channel integrates stimulus energy over time.},

abstract = {Touch differs from other exteroceptive senses in that the body itself forms part of the tactile percept. Interactions between proprioception and touch provide a powerful way to investigate the implicit body representation underlying touch. Here, we demonstrate that an intrinsic primary quality of a tactile object, for example its size, is directly affected by the perceived size of the body part touching it. We elicited proprioceptive illusions that the left index finger was either elongating or shrinking by vibrating the biceps or triceps tendon of the right arm while subjects grasped the tip of their left index finger. Subjects estimated the distance between two simultaneous tactile contacts on the left finger during tendon vibration. We found that tactile distances feel bigger when the touched body part feels elongated. Control tests showed that the modulation of touch was linked to the perceived index-finger size induced by tendon vibration. Vibrations that did not produce proprioceptive illusion had no effect on touch. Our results show that the perception of tactile objects is referenced to an implicit body representation and that proprioception contributes to this body representation. We also provide, for the first time, a quantitative, implicit measure of distortions of body size. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The principle of common coding suggests that a joint representation is formed when actions are repeatedly paired with a specific perceptual event. Musicians are occupationally specialized with regard to the coupling between actions and their auditory effects. In the present study, we employed a novel paradigm to demonstrate automatic action-effect associations in pianists. Pianists and nonmusicians pressed keys according to aurally presented number sequences. Numbers were presented at pitches that were neutral, congruent, or incongruent with respect to pitches that would normally be produced by such actions. Response time differences were seen between congruent and incongruent sequences in pianists alone. A second experiment was conducted to determine whether these effects could be attributed to the existence of previously documented spatial/pitch compatibility effects. In a "stretched" version of the task, the pitch distance over which the numbers were presented was enlarged to a range that could not be produced by the hand span used in Experiment 1. The finding of a larger response time difference between congruent and incongruent trials in the original, standard, version compared with the stretched version, in pianists, but not in nonmusicians, indicates that the effects obtained are, at least partially, attributable to learned action effects.},

abstract = {The widespread availability of high-performance, affordable personal computers has brought a new wealth of possibilities regarding real-time control of musical parameters. In fact, real-time gestural control of computer music has become a major trend in recent years (e.g., Wanderley and Battier 2000). Various input devices for musical expression— also called hardware interfaces, control surfaces,or (gestural) controllers—have been proposed (Penny- cook 1985; Roads 1996; Paradiso 1997; Mulder 1998; Bongers 2000, Cook 2001; Piringer 2001). These devices can be roughly classified into several categories: instrument-like controllers that try to emulate the control interfaces of existing acoustic instruments; instrument-inspired controllers that are basically designed loosely following the charac- teristics of existing instruments (but that do not necessarily seek an emulation of their counter- parts); extended instruments, that is, acoustic in- struments augmented by the use of several sensors; and alternate controllers, whose designs do not fol- low that of any existing instrument. A more careful examination reveals two main trends behind these categories: the tendency to de- sign controllers to best fit some already developed motor control ability (the case of the first three categories), or an attempt to deliberately avoid any relationship to gestural vocabularies associated to existing instruments, therefore allowing the use of different movements and postures not traditionally used in music performance.},

The deformations of this membrane cause an array of 112 skin contactors to create programmable lateral stress fields in the skin of the finger pad.

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of strength perception for vibration signals used in mobile devices. Employing devices similar to standard cell phones and using pulsed vibration signals to combat adaptation effects, experiments were performed to study the effect of weight and underlying vibration frequency on perceived strength. Results shows that for the same measured acceleration on the device, a heavier box is perceived to vibrate with greater strength. Furthermore, signals with higher underlying frequency are perceived to be weaker for the same measured acceleration. While our results are consistent with previous studies, they are obtained for the specific condition of ungrounded, vibrating objects held in the hand. Our results suggest the need for a systematic correction law for use by designers to specify the vibratory characteristics of a device as a function of its weight and of the desired operating frequency.},

Three different models to provide tactile feedback are introduced: amplitude- and frequency modulation and granular synthesis. Then, an experiment investigating the effect of the feedback models on force control is reported. The tactile feedback conditions were compared to each other and to a condition with no feedback in a force repetition and a force hold tasks. In the force repetition task, all the feedback conditions yielded significantly better accuracy compared to no feedback condition. In the force hold task, there was no difference in the accuracy between the conditions including the no feedback condition. The results suggest that dynamic vibrotactile feedback assists the force control in force repetition tasks.},

abstract = {We present TUIC, a technology that enables tangible interaction on capacitive multi-touch devices, such as iPad, iPhone, and 3M's multi-touch displays, without requiring any hardware modifications. TUIC simulates finger touches on capacitive displays using passive materials and active modulation circuits embedded inside tangible objects, and can be used with multi-touch gestures simultaneously. TUIC consists of three approaches to sense and track objects: spatial, frequency, and hybrid (spatial plus frequency). The spatial approach, also known as 2D markers, uses geometric, multi-point touch patterns to encode object IDs. Spatial tags are straightforward to construct and are easily tracked when moved, but require sufficient spacing between the multiple touch points. The frequency approach uses modulation circuits to generate high-frequency touches to encode object IDs in the time domain. It requires fewer touch points and allows smaller tags to be built. The hybrid approach combines both spatial and frequency tags to construct small tags that can be reliably tracked when moved and rotated. We show three applications demonstrating the above approaches on iPads and 3M's multi-touch displays.},

abstract = {Studied the effect of removing auditory feedback on keyboard performance by focusing specifically on parameters of expression in piano performance: horizontal and vertical timing, horizontal and vertical dynamics, and pedaling. Six pianists (the {\%}A and young musicians with professional piano training) performed a short musical excerpt from a Chopin etude 10 times on a digital piano in each of 4 conditions: expressive or metronomic, with and without feedback. The data analyses revealed significant effects of feedback deprivation on all expressive parameters in both expressive and metronomic performance. However, these effects were very small, except for some substantial changes in pedaling by some pianists. To determine the perceptual and aesthetic significance of these effects, a group of 10 (undergraduate) pianist listeners was presented with a forced-choice test in which expressive performances produced with and without feedback were paired. The listeners correctly identified the performance played without feedback on only 63.5{\%} of the trials, which confirms the relative subtlety of the effects of feedback deprivation.

In vision, the number of dimensions can be estimated to be seven. This observation raises the question of what is the number of dimensions needed to describe touch. Only with certain simplified representations of mechanical interactions can this number be estimated, because it is in general infinite. Organisms must be sensitive to considerably reduced subsets of all possible measurements. These reductions are discussed by considering the sensing apparatuses of some animals and the underlying mechanisms of two haptic illusions.},

In Experiment 1, the percepts were independent, and there were no interactions between processes for verbal and visuomotor responses.

The statistical relation between force and torque was manipulated across four experimental conditions: either one type of cue varied while the other was constant, or both varied so as to be positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated. Experiment 1 showed that the subjects' ability to discriminate force was improved by positively correlated torque but impaired with uncorrelated torque, as compared to the constant torque condition. Corresponding effects were found in Experiment 2 for the influence of force on torque discrimination. These findings indicate that force and torque are integrated in perception, rather than being processed as separate dimensions. A further experiment demonstrated facilitation of stiffness discrimination by correlated force and torque, whether the correlation was positive or negative. The findings suggest new means of augmenting haptic feedback to facilitate perception of the properties of soft objects.},

abstract = {The fingertip pulp modulates the force transmitted to the underlying musculoskeletal system during finger contact on external bodies. A model of the fingertip pulp is needed to represent the transmission of forces to the tendons, muscles, and bone during these contacts. In this study, a structural model of the in vivo human fingertip was developed that incorporates both the material inhomogeneity and geometry. Study objectives were to determine (1) if this fingertip model can predict the force-displacement and force-contact area responses of the in vivo human fingertip during contact with a flat, rigid surface, and (2) if the stresses and strains predicted by this model are consistent with the tactile sensing functionality of the in vivo human fingertip. The in vivo fingertip pulp was modeled as an inflated, ellipsoidal membrane, containing an incompressible fluid, that is quasi-statically compressed against a flat, frictionless surface. The membrane was assigned properties of skin and when inflated, possessed dimensions approximating those of a human fingertip. Finite deformation was allowed. The model was validated by the pulp force-displacement relationship obtained by Serina et al. and by measurements of the contact area when the fingertip was pressed against a rigid surface with contact forces between 0.25 and 7.0 N. Model predictions represent the experimental data sufficiently well, suggesting that geometry, inhomogeneous material structure, and initial skin tension appear to represent the nonlinear response of the in vivo human fingertip pulp under compression. The predicted response of the fingertip pulp is consistent with its functionality as a tactile sensor.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that augmented feedback, provided by a human expert or a technical display, effectively enhances motor learning. However, discussion of the way to most effectively provide augmented feedback has been controversial. Related studies have focused primarily on simple or artificial tasks enhanced by visual feedback. Recently, technical advances have made it possible also to investigate more complex, realistic motor tasks and to implement not only visual, but also auditory, haptic, or multimodal augmented feedback. The aim of this review is to address the potential of augmented unimodal and multimodal feedback in the framework of motor learning theories. The review addresses the reasons for the different impacts of feedback strategies within or between the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and the challenges that need to be overcome to provide appropriate feedback in these modalities, either in isolation or in combination. Accordingly, the design criteria for successful visual, auditory, haptic, and multimodal feedback are elaborated.},

Participants made same/different judgments on pairs of complex waveforms presented sequentially to the back through voice coils embedded in a conforming chair. Discrimination between cello, piano, and trombone tones matched for F0, duration, and magnitude was above chance with white noise masking the sound output of the voice coils (Experiment 1), with additional masking to control for bone-conducted sound (Experiment 2), and among a group of deaf individuals (Experiment 4a). Hearing (Experiment 3) and deaf individuals (Experiment 4b) also successfully discriminated between dull and bright timbres varying only with regard to spectral centroid. We propose that, as with auditory discrimination of musical timbre, vibrotactile discrimination may involve the cortical integration of filtered output from frequency-tuned mechanoreceptors functioning as critical bands.},

For each publication that explicitly mentioned the term “evaluation”, we looked for: a) What targets and stakeholders were considered? b) What goals were set? c) What criteria were used? d) What methods were used? e) How long did the evaluation last? Results show different understandings of evaluation, with little con- sistency regarding the usage of the word. Surprisingly in some cases, not even basic information such as goal, criteria and methods were provided. In this paper, we attempt to provide an idea of what “evaluation” means for the NIME community, pushing the discussion towards how could we make a better use of evaluation on NIME design and what criteria should be used regarding each goal.},

A survey of current software solutions for creating haptic virtual environments is provided, with a discussion on the need to integrate such a platform with currently accepted solutions for audio research. A system was developed to combine a haptic programming library with a physical dy- namics engine and to expose its functionality through the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol, an increasingly accepted standard for communication within the audio software and hardware domain. Using OSC messaging, simple 3D objects can be instantiated and constraints on their movement can be specified, allowing the description of physically dy- namic mechanisms. Collision events as well as properties of the objects can be transmitted to the audio system continually to be used for modulating audio synthesis parameters. Some examples of simple virtual musical instruments created with the aid of this system are provided.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare multimodal information processing in the somatosensory and auditory cortices and related multimodal areas in musicians (trumpet players) and non-musicians. Magnetoencephalographic activity (MEG) was recorded in response to five stimulus conditions from 10 professional trumpet players and nine musically untrained control subjects. Somatosensory and auditory stimuli were presented alone or in combination. Our data suggest that musicians, in general, process multisensory stimuli differently to the control group. When stimulating the lip in professional trumpet players, a multimodal interaction (expressed as difference between the multimodal response and the sum of unimodal responses) in the corresponding somatosensory cortex showed a positive peak at 33 ms, which was not found in the control group. Conversely, the control group shows a significant interaction of opposite polarity around 60-80 ms. We suggest that training-induced reorganization in musicians leads to a qualitatively different way to process multisensory information. It favors an early stage of cortical processing, which is modified by the connections between multimodal and auditory neurons from thalamus to primary somatosensory area.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of auditory feedback derived from one keystroke in the control of the rhythmicity and velocity of successive keystrokes during piano playing. We examined the effects of transient auditory perturbations with respect to the pitch, loudness, and timing of one tone on subsequent keystrokes while six pianists played short excerpts from three simple musical pieces having different tempi ("event rates"). Immediately after a delay in tone production, the inter-keystroke interval became shorter. This compensatory action depended on the tempo, being most prominent at the medium tempo. This indicates that temporal information provided by auditory feedback is utilized to regulate the timing of movement elements produced in a sequence. We also found that the keystroke velocity changed after the timing, pitch, or loudness of a tone was altered, although the response differed depending on the type of perturbation. While delaying the timing or altering the pitch led to an increase in the velocity, altering the loudness changed the velocity in an inconsistent manner. Furthermore, perturbing a tone elicited by the right hand also affected the rhythmicity and velocity of keystrokes with the left hand, indicating that bimanual coordination of tone production was maintained. Finally, altering the pitch sometimes resulted in striking an incorrect key, mostly in the slow piece, emphasizing the importance of pitch information for accurate planning and execution of sequential piano keystrokes.},

abstract = {Musical training is associated with behavioral and neurophysiological enhancements in auditory processing for both musical and nonmusical sounds (e.g., speech). Yet, whether the benefits of musicianship extend beyond enhancements to auditory-specific skills and impact multisensory (e.g., audiovisual) processing has yet to be fully validated. Here, we investigated multisensory integration of auditory and visual information in musicians and nonmusicians using a double-flash illusion, whereby the presentation of multiple auditory stimuli (beeps) concurrent with a single visual object (flash) induces an illusory perception of multiple flashes. We parametrically varied the onset asynchrony between auditory and visual events (leads and lags of ±300 ms) to quantify participants' "temporal window" of integration, i.e., stimuli in which auditory and visual cues were fused into a single percept. Results show that musically trained individuals were both faster and more accurate at processing concurrent audiovisual cues than their nonmusician peers; nonmusicians had a higher susceptibility for responding to audiovisual illusions and perceived double flashes over an extended range of onset asynchronies compared to trained musicians. Moreover, temporal window estimates indicated that musicians' windows ({\textless}100 ms) were {\~{}}2-3× shorter than nonmusicians' ({\~{}}200 ms), suggesting more refined multisensory integration and audiovisual binding. Collectively, findings indicate a more refined binding of auditory and visual cues in musically trained individuals. We conclude that experience-dependent plasticity of intensive musical experience extends beyond simple listening skills, improving multimodal processing and the integration of multiple sensory systems in a domain-general manner.},

Haptic feedback is rendered via a PhantomR physically-based audiomodel of impact, in which the colliding objects are described as modal resonators that interact through a non-linear impact force. The impact force can be controlled through a stiffness parameter, that influences the contact time of the impact. Previous studies have already indicated that this parameter has a major influence on the au- ditory perception of hardness/stiffness. In the experiment subjects had to tap on virtual surfaces, and were presented with audio-haptic feed- back. In each condition the haptic stiffness had the same value while the acoustic stiffness was varied. Perceived stiffness was determined us- ing an absolute magnitude-estimation procedure: subjects were asked to rate the surfaces on an ordered scale of verbal labels, based on their per- ceived stiffness.

abstract = {The peripheral mechanoreceptive system in the skin consists of several functional components: the mechanical response of the skin, the mechanical response of the end organ, the creation of the generator potential, the initiation of an action potential, and (for some units) the branching structure of the afferent fibers. Experimentally, only the stimulus applied to the surface of the skin and the final afferent nerve fiber response (as the signal propagates toward the central nervous system) can be measured. The system must therefore be treated as a series of black boxes for which we only have access to the first input and the last output. Previous research has focused on one or another of these boxes and related them to the final output, despite the fact that the components act together to produce the response and cannot be treated in isolation. Here we examine the system as a whole, with the goal of attributing different aspects of the final nerve fiber response to the various components of the system. Our approach is to determine the components which are necessary and sufficient to describe this overall system response.},

abstract = {A wide variety of tactile sensations arise from the activation of several types of mechanoreceptor-afferent channels scattered all over the body, and their projections create a somatotopic map in the somatosensory cortex. Recent findings challenge the traditional view that tactile signals from different mechanoreceptor-channels/locations are independently processed in the brain, though the contribution of signal integration to perception remains obscure. Here we show that vibrotactile frequency perception is functionally enriched by signal integration across different mechanoreceptor channels and separate skin locations. When participants touched two sinusoidal vibrations of far-different frequency, which dominantly activated separate channels with the neighboring fingers or the different hand and judged the frequency of one vibration, the perceived frequency shifted toward the other (assimilation effect). Furthermore, when the participants judged the frequency of the pair as a whole, they consistently reported an intensity-based interpolation of the two vibrations (averaging effect). Both effects were similar in magnitude between the same and different hand conditions and significantly diminished by asynchronous presentation of the vibration pair. These findings indicate that human tactile processing is global and flexible in that it can estimate the ensemble property of a large-scale tactile event sensed by various receptors distributed over the body.},

abstract = {A novel sensory substitution technique is presented. Kinesthetic and cutaneous force feedback are substituted by cutaneous feedback only, provided by two wearable devices able to apply forces to the index finger and the thumb, while holding a handle during a teleoperation task. The force pattern, fed back to the user while using the cutaneous devices, is similar, in terms of intensity and area of application, to the cutaneous force pattern applied to the finger pad while interacting with a haptic device providing both cutaneous and kinesthetic force feedback. The pattern generated using the cutaneous devices can be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic feedback and the kinesthetic part of it. For this reason, we refer to this approach as sensory subtraction instead of sensory substitution. A needle insertion scenario is considered to validate the approach. The haptic device is connected to a virtual environment simulating a needle insertion task. Experiments show that the perception of inserting a needle using the cutaneous-only force feedback is nearly indistinguishable from the one felt by the user while using both cutaneous and kinesthetic feedback. Asmost of the sensory substitution approaches, the proposed sensory subtraction technique also has the advantage of not suffering from stability issues of teleoperation systems due, for instance, to communication delays. Moreover, experiments show that the sensory subtraction technique outperforms sensory substitution with more conventional visual feedback.},

abstract = {Are cross-modality matches based on absolute equivalences between the intensities of perceptual experiences in different senses, or are they based on relative positions within the respective sets of stimuli? To help answer this question, we conducted a series of three experiments; in each the levels of stimulus magnitude in one modality stayed constant while the levels in the other changed from session to session. Results obtained by two methods---magnitude matching and cross-modal differ-ence estimation--agreed in revealing the following: First, the eross-modality matches seem to repre-sent in all cases a compromise between absolute equivalence and relative (contextual) comparison, the compromise being about 50-50 for both auditory loudness versus vibratory loudness and audi-tory loudness versus visual brightness, but more nearly, though not wholly, absolute for perceived auditory duration versus visual duration. Second, individual variations abounded, with some sub-jects evidencing totally absolute matching, others totally relative matching (with little consistency, however, between tasks or between comparisons of different pairs of modalities). Third, the judg-ments of cross-modal difference were consistent with a model of linear subtraction, and in the case of loudness, the underlying scale was roughly compatible with Stevens's sone scale. Finally, a model designed to describe sequential dependencies in response can account for at least part of the context-induced changes in cross-modal equivalence. For more than a century--ever since its inception as a disci-pline--psychophysics has largely concerned itself with the per-ception and judgment of intensity Loudness and brightness, heaviness and warmth, touch intensity and taste intensity--these and other manifestations of sensation magnitude continue to engage the attention of psychophysicists of diverse persua-sions. Why the emphasis on this particular attribute? One reason for the attention lavished on intensity comes from its nature, from its own attributes and characteristics. For if intensity is not propaedeutic to the domain of psychophysics, then at least it is prototypical: As acknowledged by researchers from Wundt 0 8 7 4) and Kiilpe 0 8 9 3) to B{\~{}}k{\~{}}sy (1967) and Stevens 0975), intensity is one of the "common" attributes, pertaining to all sensory modalities. Moreover, it is perhaps the only common attribute that corresponds to what John Locke (1690) called a "secondary" as opposed to a "primary quality:' Whereas primary qualities refer to those properties of objects and events that are perceived "as they are" and can be perceived in concert by different senses (spatial extent is a good example), secondary qualities---the microscopic rather than the macro-scopic properties of the physical w o r l d --a r e perceived not "as they are" but in accordance with the nature of the processing modality. Although Locke did not mention intensity as an attri-bute of sensory experience (color and scent were among his ex-amples of perceptions of secondary qualities), his account seems clearly to place intensity within the domain of the},

abstract = {Musicians often say that they not only hear, but also "feel" music. To explore the contribution of tactile information in "feeling" musical rhythm, we investigated the degree that auditory and tactile inputs are integrated in humans performing a musical meter recognition task. Subjects discriminated between two types of sequences, 'duple' (march-like rhythms) and 'triple' (waltz-like rhythms) presented in three conditions: 1) Unimodal inputs (auditory or tactile alone), 2) Various combinations of bimodal inputs, where sequences were distributed between the auditory and tactile channels such that a single channel did not produce coherent meter percepts, and 3) Simultaneously presented bimodal inputs where the two channels contained congruent or incongruent meter cues. We first show that meter is perceived similarly well (70{\%}-85{\%}) when tactile or auditory cues are presented alone. We next show in the bimodal experiments that auditory and tactile cues are integrated to produce coherent meter percepts. Performance is high (70{\%}-90{\%}) when all of the metrically important notes are assigned to one channel and is reduced to 60{\%} when half of these notes are assigned to one channel. When the important notes are presented simultaneously to both channels, congruent cues enhance meter recognition (90{\%}). Performance drops dramatically when subjects were presented with incongruent auditory cues (10{\%}), as opposed to incongruent tactile cues (60{\%}), demonstrating that auditory input dominates meter perception. We believe that these results are the first demonstration of cross-modal sensory grouping between any two senses.},

abstract = {Presentation of music as vibration to the skin has the potential to facilitate interaction between musicians with hearing impairments and other musicians during group performance. Vibrotactile thresholds have been determined to assess the potential for vibrotactile presentation of music to the glabrous skin of the fingertip, forefoot and heel. No significant differences were found between the thresholds for sinusoids representing notes between C1 and C6 when presented to the fingertip of participants with normal hearing and with a severe or profound hearing loss. For participants with normal hearing, thresholds for notes between C1 and C6 showed the characteristic U-shape curve for the fingertip, but not for the forefoot and heel. Compared to the fingertip, the forefoot had lower thresholds between C1 and C3, and the heel had lower thresholds between C1 and G2; this is attributed to spatial summation from the Pacinian receptors over the larger contactor area used for the forefoot and heel. Participants with normal hearing assessed the perception of high-frequency vibration using 1s sinusoids presented to the fingertip and were found to be more aware of transient vibration at the beginning and/or end of notes between G4 and C6 when stimuli were presented 10dB above threshold, rather than at threshold. An average of 94{\%} of these participants reported feeling continuous vibration between G4 and G5 with stimuli presented 10dB above threshold. Based on the experimental findings and consideration of health effects relating to vibration exposure, a suitable range of notes for vibrotactile presentation of music is identified as being from C1 to G5. This is more limited than for human hearing but the fundamental frequencies of the human voice, and the notes played by many instruments, lie within it. However, the dynamic range might require compression to avoid the negative effects of amplitude on pitch perception.},

abstract = {We introduced haptic cues to the serial reaction time (SRT) task alongside the standard visual cues to explore the relative contributions of haptic and visual cues to motor memory and perceptual memory. Motor learning is a complex process that likely depends on the availability of haptic sensory feedback. Motor learning is also often an implicit process, wherein the learner is not even aware that learning is taking place. The SRT task was devised to study implicit learning. Reaction times (RTs) are reduced with practice even in the absence of explicit learning about a sequence embedded in a train of cues. We adopted an SRT protocol developed by Willingham in 1999 to determine whether haptic cues contribute differently than visual cues to the balance of motor and perceptual learning. Experimental results involving 32 participants showed that sequence learning occurs implicitly with haptic stimuli to much the same extent as visual stimuli. Also, it was revealed that the dependence on motor memory (as opposed to perceptual memory) was greater in the group responding to haptic cues than the group responding to visual cues. Comparing the dependence on motor versus perceptual memory, the haptic group reached marginal significance (p=.09), whereas the visual group difference was not significant (p=.23).},

The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested.

This refers to when phone users perceive their device to vibrate, indicating that a call or text is incoming, when in fact the phone did not vibrate at all. Though these studies show that most users do not find phantom vibration hallucinations to be very bothersome, they also find that a large majority of users experience this phenomenon. This paper explores what the striking prevalence of phantom vibration syndrome means for our contemporary relationships with technology. I begin with a review of the theories purporting to explain these data, which largely rely on particular understandings of the brain. Next I develop an alternative theory of phantom vibration syndrome based on insights from the philosophical tradition of phenomenology. This account considers the ways users develop bodily and perceptual habits regarding how the phone is understood and used. By critically contrasting these different theories, we can refine our questions about what the high prevalence of phantom vibration syndrome implies about our contemporary technological situation.},

abstract = {We describe a new haptic force feedback device capable of creating lateral shear force on a bare fingertip - the eShiver. The eShiver creates a net lateral force from in-plane oscillatory motion of a surface synchronized with a "friction switch" based on Johnsen-Rahbek electroadhesion. Using an artificial finger, a maximum net lateral force of 300 mN is achieved at 55 Hz lateral oscillation frequency, and net force is shown to be a function of velocity and applied voltage, as well as the phase between them. A second set of experiments is carried out on a human finger, and a lateral force of up to 450 mN is achieved at a lateral oscillation frequency of 1000 Hz. This force is reached at a peak lateral surface velocity of 400 mm/s and a peak applied voltage of 400 V. We develop a simple lumped parameter model of the eShiver, and a time domain simulation of the artificial finger is shown to agree with the experimental results. Three distinct zones of operation are found, which predict the limitations of force generation and which may be used for optimization. The human finger is found to be similar to the artificial finger in its dependence on actuation parameters, suggesting that the same lumped parameter model may be applied, albeit with different parameters. Curiously, the friction force due to Johnsen-Rahbek electroadhesion is found to increase substantially over time as the finger remains in contact with the surface. Considerations for optimizing the performance of the eShiver are discussed.},

abstract = {Mobile computing devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) that have low-friction surfaces require well-directed fingertip forces of sufficient and precise magnitudes for proper use. Although general impairments in manual dexterity are well-documented in older adults, it is unclear how these sensorimotor impairments influence the ability of older adults to dexterously manipulate fixed, low-friction surfaces in particular. 21 young and 18 older (65+ yrs) adults produced maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) and steady submaximal forces (2.5 and 10{\%} MVC) with the fingertip of the index finger. A Teflon covered custom-molded splint was placed on the fingertip. A three-axis force sensor was covered with either Teflon or sandpaper to create low- and high-friction surfaces, respectively. Maximal downward forces (F(z)) were similar (p = .135) for young and older adults, and decreased by 15{\%} (p{\textless}.001) while pressing on Teflon compared to sandpaper. Fluctuations in F(z) during the submaximal force-matching tasks were 2.45× greater (p{\textless}.001) for older adults than in young adults, and reached a maximum when older adults pressed against the Teflon surface while receiving visual feedback. These age-associated changes in motor performance are explained, in part, by altered muscle activity from three hand muscles and out-of-plane forces. Quantifying the ability to produce steady fingertip forces against low-friction surfaces may be a better indicator of impairment and disability than the current practice of evaluating maximal forces with pinch meters. These age-associated impairments in dexterity while interacting with low-friction surfaces may limit the use of the current generation of computing interfaces by older adults.},

Vibration at a frequency of 300 cpm and an amplitude of 6 mm, or at a frequency of 1000 cpm and an amplitude of 3 mm, were applied until the subject could no longer tolerate them (a 20 min period) by a noise-controlled vibration exciter. There was no significant change in threshold sensitivity after exposure to vibration alone. Exposure to vibration and noise simultaneously caused greater threshold shifts (TTS) and longer recovery time than exposure to noise alone. This was especially true with 1000 cpm vibration. It was suggested that the effects of the combined noise and vibration might be the results of some disturbances of physiological homeostasis or possible mechanical interactions with its blood supply.

Three separate experiments were conducted. First, we measured vibrotactile thresholds as a function of frequency of vibration, using a cylindrical contactor of 0.7mm diameter. The results of our experiment showed similar trends to that of previous physiological results that used a larger contactor. In the second experiment, vibrotactile spatial acuities were investigated. Two- point localization errors were measured on the tip of the index finger and on thenar eminence as a function of frequency of vibration. The results show that human skin is sensitive to spatial differences at the frequency bands of 1-3Hz and 18-32Hz. The subjects' spatial acuities gradually decreased as the frequency of vibration increased over 50Hz. In the third experiment, impedances function of frequency of vibration. From these results, we discuss the of human skin were measured as a implications in the designing of spatially distributed tactile displays and methods for texture display.},

abstract = {Prior research on large-fibre skin mechanoreceptors in humans and monkeys has demonstrated their sensitivity to perpendicular skin indentation and to the rate of force application. Although some studies have examined skin afferent responses to stretch, relatively few investigations have examined the neural and perceptual correlates of shear forces applied tangentially to the skin. The present study assessed the ability of human subjects to scale different levels of tangential force applied to the distal pad of the index finger. Subjects were instructed to choose their own magnitude estimation scale. Seven force levels ranging from 0.15 to 0.70 N were delivered randomly at rates of 0.10 N/s, 0.15 N/s or 0.30 N/s. Tangential forces were produced with a smooth metal spatula coated with an adhesive to insure a shear force on the underlying skin without slip. The same procedures were also used to generate skin indentation with normal forces. The results showed that most human subjects were able to scale different magnitudes of both tangential and normal forces applied to the tip of the index finger. The rate of force change did not influence the perception of the applied forces. These results highlight the potentially important role of tangential forces in haptic perception.},

Alterations of auditory feedback can profoundly disrupt performance, though not all alterations cause dis- ruption and different alterations generate different types of disruption. Recent results have revealed a basic distinction between the role of feedback contents (musical pitch) and the degree to which feedback onsets are synchronized with actions.

As grands are considered to be superior to uprights, this suggests that it may be possible to improve upright pianos by reducing the strength of the broadband component of vibrations.},

Start- ing from a state of the art which outlines two main approaches to the problem of ”making sound with gestures”, we will delve into psychological theories about expressiveness, describing in partic- ular possible applications dealing with intermodality and mixed reality environments related to the Gestalt Theory. HCI design can indeed benefit from this kind of approach because of the quanti- tative methods that can be applied to measure expressiveness. In- terfaces can be used in order to convey expressiveness, which is a plus of information that can help interacting with the machine; this kind of information can be coded as spatio-temporal schemes, as it is stated in Gestalt theory.},

Each cube was identical in construction, but half the instruments were configured for two degrees of freedom while the other half allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video, sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive effect of reducing the exploration of the instrument's affordances; this suggested the presence of a dominant constraint in one of the two configurations which strongly differentiated the process of appropriation across the two groups of participants.},

An acute but temporary rise in threshold occurred as a consequence of the vibration exposure in three different unit types (FA I, FA II and SA I). A close correlation was found between the neural and psychophysical thresholds with regard to the magnitudes of the shifts and the time courses of the recovery, provided that the thresholds were measured at the appropriate frequencies (i.e. at 200, 20 and 2 Hz while recording from FA II, FA I and SA I units, respectively).

abstract = {Humanhaptic performance is not fixed, but subject to major alterations through learning processes.We describe anewstimulation protocol that allows to improve haptic performance in humans in a highly systemic way through unattended activation-based learning. The so-called coactivation protocol is based upon temporal constraints of Hebbian learning where simultaneity plays a key role for the induction of plastic changes.We provide an overview about the potential of coactivation by summarizing recent findings showing that coactivation alters a broad range of basic as well as cognitively demanding types of haptic performance in parallel to cortical reorganization in somatosensory cortex. For example, coactivation applied to the tip of the index finger, or to all fingers of the dominant hand improves tactile acuity, but also haptic object recognition, and speeds up multiple-choice reaction times. Because such changes persist between 24 h and 1 week without further intervention, we interpret the underlying processes as a particular form of perceptual learning.We describe results where coactivation has been utilized for therapeutical purposes in impaired human populations, we outline new developments to optimize and extend unattended activation-based learning protocols, and we sketch the next steps necessary to apply the concept of unattended activation-based learning on a regular and reliable basis as a therapeutical tool in order to selectively interfere with impaired haptic performance.

Because of mechanical string-structure coupling, the string vibration, and therefore the sound, substantially depends on the lutherie parameters. This study focuses on the comparison between ebony-fingerboard and rosewood-fingerboard guitars: is achange in the fingerboard wood perceivedbythe guitar players? In order to test the hypothesis that it is actually perceived, apsychological investigation is carried out. Twoexperimental methods are used: afree sorting task with recorded stimuli from the guitars (listening test)and afree verbali- sation task where the guitarists play the guitars. In the listening test, the guitarists perceive differences between guitars, butthe resulting clusters do not showanebony/rosewood dichotomy.Alinguistic analysis of the verbali- sations exhibits psychological descriptors that are relevant for the discrimination of the wood of the fingerboard: PRECISION (referring to howeach note stands out from others), and to alesser extent ATTACK (referring to the guitar'sresponse to musician'sgesture)and BALANCE (referring to the frequencycontent). This study is part of abroader project aiming at establishing an explicite relation between mechanics, perception, and lutherie. A physical interpretation of the psychologically-relevant descriptors is eventually proposed in order to use them as hypotheses in afurther hypothetico-deductive approach starting from physics and using psychophysical methods.},

abstract = {An efficient and fast auditory-motor network is a basic resource for trained musicians due to the importance of motor anticipation of sound production in musical performance. When playing an instrument, motor performance always goes along with the production of sounds and the integration between both modalities plays an essential role in the course of musical training. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of task-irrelevant auditory feedback during motor performance in musicians using a serial reaction time task (SRTT). Our hypothesis was that musicians, due to their extensive auditory-motor practice routine during musical training, have superior performance and learning capabilities when receiving auditory feedback during SRTT relative to musicians performing the SRTT without any auditory feedback. Behaviorally, we found that auditory feedback reinforced SRTT performance of the right hand (referring to absolute response speed) while learning capabilities remained unchanged. This finding highlights a potential important role for task-irrelevant auditory feedback in motor performance in musicians, a finding that might provide further insight into auditory-motor integration independent of the trained musical context.},

abstract = {The effect of fatigue on finger force perception within a hand during ipsilateral finger force matching was examined. Thirteen subjects were instructed to match a reference force of an instructed finger using the same or different finger within the hand before and after index finger fatigue. Absolute reference force targets for the index or little finger were identical during pre- and post-fatigue sessions. Fatigue was induced by a 60-s sustained maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the index finger. Index finger MVC decreased approximately 29{\%}, while there was a non-significant (about 5{\%}) decrease in the little finger MVC. The results showed that: (1) the absolute reference and matching forces of the instructed fingers were not significantly changed after fatigue, while the total forces (sum of instructed and uninstructed finger forces) were increased after fatigue. (2) The relative forces (with respect to corresponding pre- and post-fatigue MVCs) of the index finger increased significantly in both reference and matching tasks, while the relative forces of the little finger remained unchanged after fatigue. (3) Matching errors remained unchanged after fatigue when the fatigued index finger produced the reference force, while the errors increased significantly when the fatigued index finger produced the matching force. (4) Enslaving (difference between total and instructed finger forces) increased significantly after fatigue, especially during force production by the fatigued index finger and when the little finger produced matching forces at higher force levels. (5) Enslaving significantly increased matching errors particularly after fatigue. Taken together, our results suggest that absolute finger forces within the hand are perceived within the CNS during ipsilateral finger force matching. Perception of absolute forces of the fatigued index finger is not altered after fatigue. The ability of the fatigued index finger to reproduce little finger forces is impaired to a certain degree, however. The impairment is likely to be attributable to altered afferent/efferent relationships of the fatigued index finger.},

abstract = {The sounds produced when we touch textured surfaces frequently provide information regarding the structure of those surfaces. It has recently been demonstrated that the perception of the texture of the hands can be modified simply by manipulating the frequency content of such touch-related sounds. We investigated whether similar auditory manipulations change people's perception of the roughness of abrasive surfaces (experiment 1). Participants were required to make speeded, forced-choice discrimination responses regarding the roughness of a series of abrasive samples which they touched briefly. Analysis of discrimination errors verified that tactile roughness perception was modulated by the frequency content of the auditory feedback. Specifically, attenuating high frequencies led to a bias towards an increased perception of tactile smoothness. In experiment 2, we replicated the rubbing-hands manipulation of previous experimenters while participants rated either the perceived roughness or wetness of their hands. The wetness scale data replicated the results in the literature, while the roughness scale data replicated the result from experiment 1. A final experiment showed that delaying the auditory feedback from the hand-rubbing reduced the magnitude of this parchment-skin illusion. These experiments demonstrate the dramatic effect that auditory frequency manipulations can have on the perceived tactile roughness and moistness of surfaces, and are consistent with the proposal that different auditory perceptual dimensions may have varying salience for different surfaces.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method of estimating fingertip forces in finger tapping movements based on human fingerpad characteristics. Since the human fingerpad exhibits elasticity, the proposed technique recreates the relationship between the fingertip force and the displacement generated between the thumb and index fingerpads as a fingerpad-stiffness model. Then, using this model, the force between the two fingertips (the fingertip force) can be estimated from the measured fingerpad deformation only. As the method does not require any sensors to be attached to the finger contact surface to measure fingertip force, it can be used to evaluate the tendency of force in natural and unconstrained finger tapping movements conducted by the subject. In the experiments conducted, fingertip forces and the displacement of the two fingerpads generated when the subjects pinched and pushed a force sensor with the thumb and index finger were measured to approximate the relationships between fingerpad force and deformation. The results indicated that human fingerpad characteristics can be expressed using a fingerpad-stiffness function (including an exponential function), and that fingerpad forces can be estimated using the proposed model. Furthermore, comparison between a Parkinson's disease (PD) patient and a healthy subject confirmed differences in the finger tapping forces for each. This implies the possibility of assessing motor function in PD patients using the finger tapping force evaluation method proposed in this paper.},

abstract = {Temporal frequency is a fundamental sensory dimension in audition and touch. In audition, analysis of temporal frequency is necessary for speech and music perception; in touch, the spectral analysis of vibratory signals has been implicated in texture perception and in sensing the environment through tools. Environmental oscillations impinging upon the ear are generally thought to be processed independently of oscillations impinging upon the skin. Here, we show that frequency channels are perceptually linked across audition and touch. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we demonstrate that auditory stimuli interfere with tactile frequency perception in a systematic manner. Specifically, performance on a tactile-frequency-discrimination task is impaired when an auditory distractor is presented with the tactile stimuli, but only if the frequencies of the auditory and tactile stimuli are similar. The frequency-dependent interference effect is observed whether the distractors are pure tones or band-pass noise, so an auditory percept of pitch is not required for the effect to be produced. Importantly, distractors that strongly impair frequency discrimination do not interfere with judgments of tactile intensity. This surprisingly specific crosstalk between different modalities reflects the importance of supramodal representations of fundamental sensory dimensions.},

abstract = {Many researchers have sought explanations for the purported tonal superiority of Old Italian violins by investigating varnish and wood properties, plate tuning systems, and the spectral balance of the radiated sound. Nevertheless, the fundamental premise of tonal superiority has been investigated scientifically only once very recently, and results showed a general preference for new violins and that players were unable to reliably distinguish new violins from old. The study was, however, relatively small in terms of the number of violins tested (six), the time allotted to each player (an hour), and the size of the test space (a hotel room). In this study, 10 renowned soloists each blind-tested six Old Italian violins (including five by Stradivari) and six new during two 75-min sessions-the first in a rehearsal room, the second in a 300-seat concert hall. When asked to choose a violin to replace their own for a hypothetical concert tour, 6 of the 10 soloists chose a new instrument. A single new violin was easily the most-preferred of the 12. On average, soloists rated their favorite new violins more highly than their favorite old for playability, articulation, and projection, and at least equal to old in terms of timbre. Soloists failed to distinguish new from old at better than chance levels. These results confirm and extend those of the earlier study and present a striking challenge to near-canonical beliefs about Old Italian violins.},

abstract = {Most tactile sensors are based on the assumption that touch depends on measuring pressure. However, the pressure distribution at the surface of a tactile sensor cannot be acquired directly and must be inferred from the deformation field induced by the touched object in the sensor medium. Currently, there is no consensus as to which components of strain are most informative for tactile sensing. Here, we propose that shape-related tactile information is more suitably recovered from shear strain than normal strain. Based on a contact mechanics analysis, we demonstrate that the elastic behavior of a haptic probe provides a robust edge detection mechanism when shear strain is sensed. We used a jamming-based robot gripper as a tactile sensor to empirically validate that shear strain processing gives accurate edge information that is invariant to changes in pressure, as predicted by the contact mechanics study. This result has implications for the design of effective tactile sensors as well as for the understanding of the early somatosensory processing in mammals.},

This is in accordance to observations of Weber's Law for reference stimuli near the perception threshold. Sta- tistical analysis suggests influence of fingertip size on the results, but no influence of fine motor activity (i.e. playing musical instruments, handi- craft, computer games) could be asserted with the given dataset.

Violinists first evaluated the violins one at a time under three experimental conditions: (1) playing, (2) listening to it (played by a professional player) in an active way by fingering the score on an isolated neck, (3) same as (2) with vibrotactile feedback provided at the isolated neck. Violinists were then asked to evaluate the violins through pairwise comparisons under condition (3): Each violin was paired with itself while the level of vibrations of the isolated neck was either the original one or divided by two. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that Loud and Powerful judgments were affected by the presence of vibrations given that violins were rated louder in condition (3) than in (2). In the second part, violins were rated more positively with original vibration level at the isolated neck than with half the level, for all criteria but Alive and Responsive. Consistently with sensory interaction, the magnitude of the enhancement remained relatively constant across violins.},

abstract = {The four information-processing channels of glabrous skin have distinct tuning characteristics which appear to be determined in the periphery at the level of sensory receptors and their afferent nerve fibers. The four-channel model [J Acoust Soc Am 84 (1988) 1680] has been updated to include measurement over a wider frequency range of tuning of the P and NP I channels, psychophysically determined by forward-masking and adaptation tuning curve methods. In addition to differences in their tuning, the P and NP channels differ in the following ways: (1) the P channel, but not NP channels, has been found to be capable of temporal summation, which operates by neural integration; (2) the capacity for spatial summation is also an exclusive property of the P channel; (3) sensitivity declines with age at a greater rate in the P channel than in the NP channels; (4) the masking or adaptation of a channel has no effect on the sensitivity of the other channels, although the channels interact in the summation of the perceived magnitudes of stimuli presented to separate channels.},
annote = {{\%} For P channel only: threshold decreases as stimulus duration increases up to a duration of about 1.0s. Other channels are insensitive.
{\%} Contact area: The larger the area of stimulation, the greater the probability that the most sensitive receptors will be activated and consequently, the psychophysical threshold is predicted to decrease as the size of the contactor is increased.},

abstract = {In this study we investigate the haptic perception of object size. We report the results from four psychophysical experiments. In the first, we ask subjects to discriminate the size of objects that vary in surface curvature and compliance while changing contact force. We show that objects exhibit size constancy such that perception of object size using haptics does not change with changes in contact force. Based on these results, we hypothesize that size perception depends on the degree of spread between the digits at initial contact with objects. In the second experiment, we test this hypothesis by having subjects continuously contact an object that changes dynamically in size. We show that size perception takes into account the compliance of the object. In the third and fourth experiments we attempt to separate the individual contributions of proprioceptive and cutaneous input. In the third, we test the ability of subjects to perceive object size after altering the sensitivity of cutaneous receptors with adapting vibratory stimuli. The results from this experiment suggest that initial contact is signaled by the cutaneous slowly adapting type 1 afferents (SA1) and/or the rapidly adapting afferents (RA). In the last experiment, we block cutaneous input at the site of contact by anesthetizing the digital nerves and show that proprioceptive information alone provides only a rough estimate of object size. We conclude that the perception of object size depends on inputs from SA1 and possibly RA afferents, combined with inputs from proprioceptive afferents that signal the spread between digits.},

abstract = {Identification of a visual target can be enhanced by a simultaneously presented high tone embedded in a sequence of low tones. This is called "freezing effect" because it is as if the target display was frozen in time by the tone. Until now, however, it has not been known whether this sound facilitation effect exists for a target with modalities other than vision, such as tactility, and if so, what its underlying mechanism is. We demonstrate, for the first time, an audio-tactile freezing effect (Experiment 1). We use a method of constant stimuli in conjunction with a 2-AFC task to determine the point of subjective equality (PSE) of the duration (Experiment 2A) or intensity (Experiment 2B) of the tactile target. Results do not support the view that a high tone expands the duration of the tactile target, but rather that the tone enhances participants' subjective tactile intensity. When the tactile intensity of the target was increased to match the shift of PSE as in Experiment 2B, this increased intensity indeed improved identification, further suggesting that intensity enhancement is the mechanism (Experiment 3). The perceived tactile intensity enhancement by a sound indicates genuine multisensory integration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).},

abstract = {Temporal processing ability for the senses of hearing and touch was examined through the measurement of gap-duration discrimination thresholds (GDDTs) employing the same low-frequency sinusoidal stimuli in both modalities. GDDTs were measured in three groups of observers (normal-hearing, hearing-impaired, and normal-hearing with simulated hearing loss) covering an age range of 21–69 yr. GDDTs for a baseline gap of 6 ms were measured for four different combinations of 100-ms leading and trailing markers (250–250, 250–400, 400–250, and 400–400 Hz). Auditory measurements were obtained for monaural presentation over headphones and tactile measurements were obtained using sinusoidal vibrations presented to the left middle finger. The auditory GDDTs of the hearing-impaired listeners, which were larger than those of the normal-hearing observers, were well-reproduced in the listeners with simulated loss. The magnitude of the GDDT was generally independent of modality and showed effects of age in both modalities. The use of different-frequency compared to same-frequency markers led to a greater deterioration in auditory GDDTs compared to tactile GDDTs and may reflect differences in bandwidth properties between the two sensory systems.},

abstract = {The difference threshold for the detection of changes in vibration amplitude was measured as a function of the intensity and frequency of stimuli delivered through a 2.9-cm2 contactor to the thenar eminence. Stimuli were either 25- or 250-Hz sinusoids, narrow-band noise centered at 250 Hz, or wideband noise. Thresholds were measured by two-interval, forced-choice tracking under three methods of stimulus presentation. In the gated-pedestal method, subjects had to judge which of two 700-ms bursts of vibration separated by 100 ms was more intense. In the continuous-pedestal method, subjects had to detect a 700-ms increment in the amplitude of an ongoing pedestal of vibration. In the two-burst-continuous-pedestal method with 1500-ms pedestals, the subject had to detect which of two successively presented pedestals contained a 500-ms amplitude increment. Thresholds were consistently lower for detecting increments in the amplitude of a continuous pedestal of vibration than for detecting amplitude differences between briefly presented successive pedestals or amplitude increments in successive pedestals. A "near miss" to Weber's law was found both for sinusoidal and for noise stimuli. The difference threshold was not affected by stimulus frequency condition.},

Yet, little is known about the unimodal versus multimodal nature of these processing streams. The main purpose of the present study was to test whether the auditory and tactile dual pathways converged into specialized multisensory brain areas. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare directly in the same subjects the brain activation related to localization and identification of comparable auditory and vibrotactile stimuli. Results indicate that the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and both left and right insula were more activated during identification conditions than during localization in both touch and audition. The reverse dissociation was found for the left and right inferior parietal lobules (IPL), the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) and the right precuneus-SPL, which were all more activated during localization conditions in the two modalities. Wepropose that specialized areas in the right IFG and the left and right insula are multisensory operators for the processing of stimulus identity whereas parts of the left and right IPL and SPL are specialized for the processing of spatial attributes independently of sensory modality.

abstract = {While much is known about sequential effects in motor timing, less is understood about whether movement parameters such as force show sequential dependencies. In this study, we examined the effect of timing constraints on repetitive unimanual force production sequences. Ten healthy participants produced a series of pinch grip forces in time to a metronome and to visually specified force amplitudes. Either visual feedback of force produced or the auditory metronome removed 10 s into the experimental trial, with participants performing continued responses for the remaining 20 s. In the continuation trials, a negative lag-1 autocorrelation in the inter-response intervals (IRIs) was observed as is commonly seen in motor timing tasks. However, removal of visual feedback resulted in a systematic increase in mean force output through the course of the trial, resulting in positive lag-1 autocorrelation values. An interaction was found between mean IRI and peak force (PF) magnitude, with greater force variability seen for the larger intervals. However, the imposition of dual force and timing constraints had no effect either on the underlying variability of the PF or on the IRIs. The results are discussed in the context of force and time being independently specified components of a generalized motor program.},

Participants had to discriminate the direction of a target stream (tactile, Experiment 1; auditory, Experiment 2) while trying to ignore the direction of a distractor stream presented in a different modality (auditory, Experiment 1; tactile, Experiment 2). The distractor streams could either be spatiotemporally congruent or incongruent with respect to the target stream. In half of the trials, the participants were presented with auditory stimuli at 75 dB(A) while in the other half of the trials they were presented with auditory stimuli at 82 dB(A). Participants' performance on both tasks was significantly affected by the intensity of the sounds. Namely, the crossmodal capture of tactile motion by audition was stronger with the more intense (vs. less intense) auditory distractors (Experiment 1), whereas the capture effect exerted by the tactile distractors was stronger for less intense (than for more intense) auditory targets (Experiment 2). The crossmodal dynamic capture was larger in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2, with a stronger congruency effect when the target streams were presented in the tactile (vs. auditory) modality. Two explanations are put forward to account for these results: an attentional biasing toward the more intense auditory stimuli, and a modulation induced by the relative perceptual weight of, respectively, the auditory and the tactile signals.},

abstract = {In two experiments we investigated the effects of voluntary movements on temporal haptic perception. Measures of sensitivity (JND) and temporal alignment (PSS) were obtained from temporal order judgments made on intermodal auditory-haptic (Experiment 1) or intramodal haptic (Experiment 2) stimulus pairs under three movement conditions. In the baseline, static condition, the arm of the participants remained stationary. In the passive condition, the arm was displaced by a servo-controlled motorized device. In the active condition, the participants moved voluntarily. The auditory stimulus was a short, 500Hz tone presented over headphones and the haptic stimulus was a brief suprathreshold force pulse applied to the tip of the index finger orthogonally to the finger movement. Active movement did not significantly affect discrimination sensitivity on the auditory-haptic stimulus pairs, whereas it significantly improved sensitivity in the case of the haptic stimulus pair, demonstrating a key role for motor command information in temporal sensitivity in the haptic system. Points of subjective simultaneity were by-and-large coincident with physical simultaneity, with one striking exception in the passive condition with the auditory-haptic stimulus pair. In the latter case, the haptic stimulus had to be presented 45ms before the auditory stimulus in order to obtain subjective simultaneity. A model is proposed to explain the discrimination performance.},

abstract = {Even though vision is only one modality we use to interact with our environment, most people identify it to be the most important. Hearing is also viewed as necessary for interpreting environmental stimuli. In contrast, touch, smell, and taste are largely ignored as being essential to the interaction we have with our environment. The brain seldom processes environmental information in sequence among the modalities but concurrently from several or all of the sensory modalities. Because humans have a limited capacity to receive, hold in working memory, and cognitively process information taken from the environment, the use of one sensory modality to convey information within a system can overload that modality. Multimodal systems can help to alleviate overload for any one modality, and such systems have been favorable in showing that the touch or tactile modality can be used as an independent input modality to convey information to the user or as a redundant modality to increase information prominence of the visual and auditory modalities. This review, which reflects work that occurred before mid-2006, discusses the following aspects of tactile modality: specific measures of tactile sensitivity for the human body, capabilities and limitations of tactile modality, and applications of human tactile interfaces. The review also highlights a gap in the tactile literature regarding tactile research for the head and other potential body locations.},
