abstract = {High-level pianists refer to and can identify nuances in timbre by way of a wide and rich vocabulary, whose abstract, imaged, and metaphoric terms acutely designate a variety of sounds. This timbre-describing lexicon is hereby studied quantitatively. The semantic proximity between pairs taken among 14 common piano timbre descriptors was evaluated in questionnaires distributed to 17 pianists. Ratings were analyzed with multidimensional scaling algorithms, yielding a four-dimensional space representing the semantic proximity between descriptors. Using cluster analyses, five main subsets were identified, within which the most familiar terms were selected. We thus obtained five descriptors which optimally describe the whole semantic space for the group of pianists taking part in this study: bright, dry, dark, round, and velvety.},

abstract = {Timbre is an essential expressive feature in piano performance. Concert pianists use a vast palette of timbral nuances to color their performances at the microstructural level. Although timbre is generally envisioned in the pianistic community as an abstract concept carried through an imaged vocabulary, performers may share some common strategies of timbral expression in piano performance. Yet there may remain further leeway for idiosyncratic processes in the production of piano timbre nuances. In this study, we examined the patterns of timbral expression in performances by four expert pianists. Each pianist performed four short pieces, each with five different timbral intentions (bright, dark, dry, round, and velvety). The performances were recorded with the high-accuracy B{\"{o}}sendorfer CEUS system. Fine-grained performance features of dynamics, touch, articulation and pedaling were extracted. Reduced PCA performance spaces and descriptive performance portraits confirmed that pianists exhibited unique, specific profiles for different timbral intentions, derived from underlying traits of general individuality, while sharing some broad commonalities of dynamics and articulation for each timbral intention. These results confirm that pianists' abstract notions of timbre correspond to reliable patterns of performance technique. Furthermore, these effects suggest that pianists can express individual styles while complying with specific timbral intentions.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents an interdisciplinary, systematic study of the expression of piano timbre by advanced-level pianists in the context of musical performance and prac- tice. To begin, general issues and aims are introduced, as well as differing definitions and perspectives on piano timbre from scientific and musical points of view. After the conception of piano timbre is presented as documented by pianists in pedagogical trea- tises, the perception and verbalisation of piano timbre is investigated with experimental and quantitative scientific methods. The words that pianists use to describe and talk about different timbral nuances are studied quantitatively, according to their semantic relationships, and a semantic map of common piano timbre descriptors is drawn out. In two separate studies, the perception of piano timbre by highly skilled pianists is investi- gated. Results suggest that advanced pianists can identify and label performer-controlled timbral nuances in audio recordings with consistency and agreement from production to perception. Finally, the production and gestural control of piano timbre in musical per- formance is explored using the B{\"{o}}sendorfer CEUS piano performance recording system.The PianoTouch toolbox, specifically developed inMATLABfor extracting performance features from high-resolution keyboard and pedalling data, is presented and used to study the expressive production of piano timbre through touch and gesture in CEUS-recorded performances by four pianists in five timbral nuances. Gestural spaces and portraits of the timbral nuances are obtained with differing patterns in intensity, attack, balance be- tween hands, articulation and pedalling. The data represents common strategies used for the expression of each timbral nuance in piano performance.},

abstract = {Musicians often say that they not only hear, but also " feel " music. To explore the contribution of tactile information in " feeling " musical rhythm, we investigated the degree that auditory and tactile inputs are integrated in humans performing a musical meter recognition task. Subjects discriminated between two types of sequences, 'duple' (march-like rhythms) and 'triple' (waltz-like rhythms) presented in three conditions: 1) Unimodal inputs (auditory or tactile alone), 2) Various combinations of bimodal inputs, where sequences were distributed between the auditory and tactile channels such that a single channel did not produce coherent meter percepts, and 3) Simultaneously presented bimodal inputs where the two channels contained congruent or incongruent meter cues. We first show that meter is perceived similarly well (70{\%}–85{\%}) when tactile or auditory cues are presented alone. We next show in the bimodal experiments that auditory and tactile cues are integrated to produce coherent meter percepts. Performance is high (70{\%}–90{\%}) when all of the metrically important notes are assigned to one channel and is reduced to 60{\%} when half of these notes are assigned to one channel. When the important notes are presented simultaneously to both channels, congruent cues enhance meter recognition (90{\%}). Performance drops dramatically when subjects were presented with incongruent auditory cues (10{\%}), as opposed to incongruent tactile cues (60{\%}), demonstrating that auditory input dominates Supporting Information Figure S1 Results of Experiment 2, meter recognition in duple sequences for bimodal M/N split and M/N half split tasks.

abstract = {ASYNCHRONY BETWEEN TACTILE AND AUDITORY feedback (action-sound latency) when playing a musical instrument is widely recognized as disruptive to musical performance. In this paper we present a study that assesses the effects of delayed auditory feedback on the timing accuracy and judgments of instrument quality for two groups of participants: professional percussio-nists and non-percussionist amateur musicians. The amounts of delay tested in this study are relatively small in comparison to similar studies of auditory delays in a musical context (0 ms, 10 ms, 10 ms + 3 ms, 20 ms). We found that both groups rated the zero latency condition as higher quality for a series of quality measures in comparison to 10 ms + 3 ms and 20 ms latency, but did not show a significant difference in rating between 10 ms latency and zero latency. Professional percussio-nists were more aware of the latency conditions and showed less variation of timing under the latency conditions , although this ability decreased as the temporal demands of the task increased. We compare our findings from each group and discuss them in relation to latency in interactive digital systems more generally and experimentally similar work on sensorimotor control and rhythmic performance.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the subjective and mechanical characterizations of single cane reeds. Subjective tests performed by a single expert gave an estimation of the subjective descriptors “ease of playing”, “brightness”, “roundness”, “projection” and “global quality”. The mechanical characterization involved measurements of static compliance, dynamic compliance, resonance frequency and Q factor of the first vibration mode. Two sets of clarinet reeds were studied. The first set contained 50 reeds identical in cut, brand and strength. The second set contained 150 reeds with 3 different cuts but identical in brand, strength and static compliance. Results show that the perceptual space is almost bi-dimensional for the first set of reeds and mono-dimensional for the second set. For the first set, the two dimensions were largely created by the descriptors ease of playing (highly correlated to brightness) and roundness. For the second set (with a constant static compliance), the main dimension was created by all the descriptors, that are correlated. The study of correlation coefficients between subjective descriptors and mechanical parameters shows that the static and dynamic compliance are correlated with the descriptor ease of playing for set 1. For set 2, the correlations are too low to make a link between the perceptual space and the objective parameters.},

@article{Saitis2017,
abstract = {In this paper, how the notion of violin quality is conveyed in spontaneous verbalizations by experi-enced violinists during preference judgments is investigated. The aims of the study were to better understand how musicians conceptualize violin quality, what aspects of the sound and the playing experience are essential, and what associations are formed between perceptual evaluation and phys-ical description. Upon comparing violins of varying make and age, players were interviewed about their preferences using open-ended questions. Concepts of violin quality were identified and cate-gorized based on the syntactic and linguistic analysis of musicians' responses. While perceived variations in how a violin sounds and feels, and consequently conceptualization structures, rely on the variations in style and expertise of different violinists, the broader semantic categories emerging from sensory descriptions remain common across performers with diverse musical profiles, reflect-ing a shared perception of physical parameter patterns that allowed the development of a musician-driven framework for understanding how the dynamic behavior of a violin might relate to its perceived quality. Implications for timbre perception and the crossmodal audio-tactile sensation of sound in music performance are discussed.},
