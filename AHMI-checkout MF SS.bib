abstract = {We present a measuring technique for radial oscillations of tube walls that are excited by variations of the internal air pressure. As an example the oscillations of organ-pipes walls were investigated by means of piezoelectric polymer films that were slightly tensioned around the pipe bodies. With patterned and uniform sensors, respectively, the well-known elliptical oscillations of the cross section as well as an additional monopole breathing of the organ-pipe body were detected. For the monopole breathing, a close relationship between the pressure distribution of the air-column resonances inside the pipe and the amplitude of the circumference oscillations along the pipe was observed.},

abstract = {We present TUIC, a technology that enables tangible interaction on capacitive multi-touch devices, such as iPad, iPhone, and 3M's multi-touch displays, without requiring any hardware modifications. TUIC simulates finger touches on capacitive displays using passive materials and active modulation circuits embedded inside tangible objects, and can be used with multi-touch gestures simultaneously. TUIC consists of three approaches to sense and track objects: spatial, frequency, and hybrid (spatial plus frequency). The spatial approach, also known as 2D markers, uses geometric, multi-point touch patterns to encode object IDs. Spatial tags are straightforward to construct and are easily tracked when moved, but require sufficient spacing between the multiple touch points. The frequency approach uses modulation circuits to generate high-frequency touches to encode object IDs in the time domain. It requires fewer touch points and allows smaller tags to be built. The hybrid approach combines both spatial and frequency tags to construct small tags that can be reliably tracked when moved and rotated. We show three applications demonstrating the above approaches on iPads and 3M's multi-touch displays.},

abstract = {Mobile touch-screen devices have the capability to accept flexible touch input, and can provide a larger screen than mobile devices with physical buttons. However, many of the user interfaces found in mobile touch-screen devices require visual feedback. This raises a number of user interface challenges. For instance, visually-demanding user interfaces make it difficult for the user to interact with mobile touch-screen devices without looking at the screen—a task the user sometimes wishes to do particularly in a mobile setting. In addition, user interfaces on mobile touch-screen devices are not generally accessible to visually impaired users. Basic tactile feedback (e.g., feedback produced by a single vibration source) can be used to enhance the user experience on mobile touch-screen devices. Unfortunately, this basic tactile feedback often lacks the expressiveness for generating vibration patterns that can be used to convey specific information about the application to the user. However, the availability of richer information accessible through the tactile channel would minimize the visual demand of an application. For example, if the user can perceive which button she is touching on the screen through tactile feedback, she would not need to view the screen, and can instead focus her visual attention towards the primary task (e.g., walking). In this dissertation, I address high visual demand issues found in existing user interfaces on mobile touch-screen devices by using spatial tactile feedback. Spatial tactile feedback means tactile feedback patterns generated in different points of the user's body (the user's fingers and palm in this work). I developed tactile feedback hardware employing multiple vibration motors on the backside of a mobile touch-screen device. These multiple vibration motors can produce various spatial vibration patterns on the user's fingers and palm. I then validated the effects of spatial tactile feedback through three different applications: eyes-free interaction, a map application for visually impaired users, and collaboration support. Findings gained through the series of application-oriented investigations indicate that spatial tactile feedback is a beneficial output modality in mobile touch-screen devices, and can mitigate some visual demand issues.},

@article{Kang2012,
abstract = {This paper proposes a method for generating a smooth directional vibrotactile flow on a thin plate. While actuating two piezoelectric actuators spatially across the plate, temporal sweeping of the input excitation frequency from zero to the first mode of the resonance frequency can smooth the perceived directional vibrotactile flow, as compared to a vibrotactile flow generated by conventional apparent tactile movement and phantom sensation methods. In order to ascertain important factors in the excitation pattern, a user study was conducted for three factors (amplitude (constant versus modulated), frequency (constant versus swept), and ending shape (sharp versus smooth)). The results showed that frequency sweeping in addition to amplitude modulation and smooth ending were the most important factors in smoothing vibrotactile flows. Moreover, an excitation signal with a smooth ending shape was important for generating nonspiky flows at the midpoint. In this study, a vibration isolation design is also proposed in order to substantially decrease the transmission of the actuator vibration to the mockup housing. As such, it is expected that the proposed vibrotactile flow generation method and vibration isolation design may be useful in applications including generating directional information in navigation maps or for identifying callers in mobile devices.

Each of the touchpads supports a three dimensional representation of musical material: two spatial dimensions plus a force measurement we typically use to control dynamics. We have developed two pad systems, one with 24 pads and a second with 2 arrays of 16 pads each. We emphasize the treatment of gestures as sub-sampled audio signals. This tight coupling of gesture with audio provides for a high degree of control intimacy. Our experiments with the pad arrays demonstrate that we can efficiently deal with large numbers of audio encoded gesture channels - 72 for the 24 pad array and 96 for the two 16 pad arrays.},

abstract = {Apraxic stroke patients need to perform repetitive arm movements to regain motor functionality, but they struggle to process the vi- sual feedback provided by typical virtual rehabilitation systems. In- stead, we imagine a low cost sleeve that can measure the movement of the upper limb and provide tactile feedback at key locations. The feedback provided by the tactors should guide the patient through a series of desired movements by allowing him or her to feel limb configuration errors at each instant in time. After discussing the relevant motion capture and actuator options, this paper describes the design and programming of our current prototype, a wearable tactile interface that uses magnetic motion tracking and shaftless eccentric mass motors. The sensors and actuators are attached to the sleeve of an athletic shirt with novel plastic caps, which also help focus the vibration on the user's skin. We connect the motors in current drive for improved performance, and we present a full parametric model for their in situ dynamic response (acceleration output given current input). 1},

In this paper, a wearable stimulation device that can produce various distributed stimuli on human skin in response to hand movements was developed using ICPF (Ionic Conducting Polymer gel Film) actuators. Characteristics of touch feel of roughness were measured using vibratory stimulation. The results showed that the threshold amplitude under active touch were smaller than under passive touch. A stimulation method which generate selective stimuli to sense receptors in accordance with velocities and accelerations of hand motions was proposed. It was confirmed experimentally that some kinds of pattern of driving waves express touch feels in response to hand movements.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a planar distributed tactile display and the evaluation of the results of its effectiveness for displaying textures. The tactile display is composed of a6 × 5 pin array actuated by 30 piezoelectric bimorphs. The distance between each pin's centers is 1.8 mm. Vertical excursion of each pin is controlled over a 0–0.7 mm range. Perceptual experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the system under three conditions: active touch, passive touch with vibration and passive touch without vibration. The experimental results showed that vibrational stimuli helped subjects discriminate tactile patterns. Measurements of the error rate during discrimination tasks were used to find an optimal vibration frequency for stimuli presented at a constant sensation level (32 SLdB above threshold). The experiment was repeated, this time holding the energy transferred mechanically to the fingertip tissue constant. At low frequencies, we found that the passive stimulation allowed subjects to discriminate just as well as active touch of static stimuli did. The results suggested newpossibilities for displaying texture using passive touch, constant energy and spatially varied vibration frequency. Keywords:},
