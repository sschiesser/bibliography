abstract = {Wireless technology is growing increasingly prevalent in the development of new interfaces for live music performance. However, with a number of different wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band, there is a high risk of interference and congestion, which has the potential to severely disrupt live performances. With its high transmission power, channel bandwidth and throughput, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) presents an opportunity for highly robust wireless communications. This paper presents our preliminary work optimising the components of a Wi-Fi system for live performance scenarios. We summarise the manufacture and testing of a prototype directional antenna that is designed to maximise sensitivity to a performer's signal while suppressing interference from elsewhere. We also propose a set of recommended Wi-Fi configurations to reduce latency and increase throughput. Practical investigations utilising these arrangements demonstrate a single x-OSC device achieving a latency of {\textless}3 ms and a distributed network of 15 devices achieving a net throughput of {\~{}}4800 packets per second ({\~{}}320 per device); where each packet is a 104-byte OSC message containing 16 analogue input channels acquired by the device.},

abstract = {Internet-based collaborative networking applica-tions, such as instant messaging, voice-over-IP telephony, and social networking, have displaced traditional communication services and redefined social interaction. The Internet has also trans-formed the music industry, revolutionizing the way music is distributed and marketed. Yet despite these two powerful trends, the intersection—where collaboration and music meet in online music-making—has remained merely a curiosity. Why? Artistically pleasing online audio collaboration requires network delay less than that encountered typically in the Internet. The bandwidth required for high-quality audio exceeds the bandwidth that is generally available on consumer-oriented broad-band access (cable and digital subscriber line [DSL]) systems. The emergence of Web 2.0, broadly defined as Web-based communities such as social-networking sites that facilitate sharing of ideas among Web users, has been significant for many existing online communities. One such community, made up of real-time Web-based music collaborators using sys-tems for networked musical performance (NMP), is in its infancy. An online NMP application lets musicians from across the globe play together over the Internet, as if they were together in a studio. With online music-making (either improvisatory or strictly notated), musicians can create ensembles without location bounds, searching for musicians around the world. The quality of the user's experi-ence is critical to the success of this Web application. However, because performing artists are highly sen-sitive to delay, network latency affects the quality of the user experience of online music-making. To achieve a good user experience the latency over the network has to be within reasonable bounds. If the delay is excessive, then the musicians will not be Computer Music Journal, 35:1, pp. 76–89, Spring 2011 c 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. able to maintain a consistent tempo. We seek to find out how the tempo of two musicians performing together via a network varies as a function of fixed network delay. Future work may consider the more general case of more than two musicians and/or variable network delay. Two musicians making music online will inde-pendently generate rhythmic patterns. Entrainment refers to an interaction between autonomous rhyth-mic processes such that they adjust to a common tempo or related tempi. Two oscillators, like two rhythmic processes, may synchronize, but other phase relationships are also possible. Entrainment and synchronization arise in many different con-texts, where there is interaction (or coupling) between oscillators, where the oscillator may be designed for a particular purpose (e. g., electronic oscillator), or occur naturally (e. g., neural oscilla-tors). Mathematical models of electronic and neural oscillators have been developed and are used to predict behavior by analysis or simulation. We are particularly interested in models for coupled oscillators with a time delay between them. One such model was developed for geographically separated oscillators with delay compensation (an-ticipation). An equivalent model was developed for mutual entrainment of two limit-cycle oscillators with time-delayed coupling. We will show that both models make the same prediction: For delays that are a small fraction of the tempo period, the mean tempo in beats per minute (BPM), or beats per second, decreases by approximately half the tempo times the delay in seconds. This result is also relevant when musicians are far apart on a stage (e. g., the opposite ends of an opera stage), as each meter of separation adds about 3 msec of delay. This article is organized as follows. We begin with a review of previous work on network musical performance systems and musical collaboration at a distance with delay. We also review previous work on entrainment and coupled oscillators. We develop 76 Computer Music Journal},

abstract = {Traditional wearable devices have various shortcomings, such as uncomfortableness for long-term wearing, and insufficient accuracy, etc. Thus, health monitoring through traditional wearable devices is hard to be sustainable. In order to obtain healthcare big data by sustainable health monitoring, we design “Smart Clothing”, facilitating unobtrusive collection of various physiological indicators of human body. To provide pervasive intelligence for smart clothing system, mobile healthcare cloud platform is constructed by the use of mobile internet, cloud computing and big data analytics. This paper introduces design details, key technologies and practical implementation methods of smart clothing system. Typical applications powered by smart clothing and big data clouds are presented, such as medical emergency response, emotion care, disease diagnosis, and real-time tactile interaction. Especially, electrocardiograph signals collected by smart clothing are used for mood monitoring and emotion detection. Finally, we highlight some of the design challenges and open issues that still need to be addressed to make smart clothing ubiquitous for a wide range of applications. {\textcopyright} 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

Ourgoal is to offer the extended control afforded by hyperinstrumentswithout the hard to reverse or irreversible invasive modificationsthat are typically used for adding digital sensing capabilities. Weutilize optical sensors to track the continuous position displacementvalues of the three trumpet valves. These values are trasmittedwirelessly and can be used by an external controller. The hardware hasbeen designed to be reconfigurable by having the housing 3D printed sothat the dimensions can be adjusted for any particular trumpetmodel. The result is a low cost, low power, easily replicable sensorsolution that offers any trumpeter the ability to augment their ownexisting trumpet without compromising the instrument's structure orplaying technique. The extended digital control afforded by our systemis interweaved with the natural playing gestures of an acoustictrumpet.

abstract = {We present interdisciplinary research undertaken for the development of an 'augmented' string quartet. Hardware and software components were especially designed to enable mixed acoustic/electronic music where bow gestures drive digital sound processes. Precisely, inertial motion sensors and a bow force sensor were added to each musician's bow, and dedicated modules allowed for the wireless data transmission to an on-line gesture analysis system. Prior to the performance, a research phase was performed to evaluate qualitatively the variability of the gesture data. Recording sessions of both gesture and audio data were carried out with a professional string quartet. The music material included a set of prototypical musical phrases containing various bowing styles and playing techniques as well as a complete music composition. The analysis of the recorded sessions allowed us to compare the consistency within and between players. While a given player was found to be generally consistent, the comparison between players revealed significant gesture idiosyncrasies. These results helped us to adapt a real-time gesture analysis system called the gesture follower. This tool was successful to automatically synchronize the live performance with electronic sound transformation in two concerts. A quantitative assessment is reported on a specific section of the piece, illustrating the accuracy and the types of errors encountered.},

Already from 2002, NIME was a conference on its own, and today it is an important annual meeting point of researchers, developers, designers, and artists from all over the world. The participants have very different backgrounds, but they all share a mutual passion for groundbreaking music and technology. More than 1200 papers have been published through the conference so far, and staying true to the open and inclusive atmosphere of the community, all of the papers are freely available online.1 The archive is great if you know what to look for, but it has grown to a size that is difficult to handle for newcomers to the field. Even for long-timers and occasional visitors, it is difficult to get an overview of the history and development of the community. At recent editions of the conference, we have seen a growing number of papers focusing on historical, theoretical, and reflective studies of the NIME community (or even communities) itself. As this level of meta-studies started to grow, we began to see the potential for a collection of articles that could broadly represent the conference series.

abstract = {A variety of short time delays inserted between pairs of subjects were found to affect their ability to synchronize a musical task. The subjects performed a clapping rhythm together from separate sound-isolated rooms via headphones and without visual contact. One-way time delays between pairs were manipulated electronically in the range of 3 to 78 ms. We are interested in quantifying the envelope of time delay within which two individuals produce synchronous performances. The results indicate that there are distinct regimes of mutually coupled behavior, and that 'natural time delay'--delay within the narrow range associated with travel times across spatial arrangements of groups and ensembles--supports the most stable performance. Conditions outside of this envelope, with time delays both below and above it, create characteristic interaction dynamics in the mutually coupled actions of the duo. Trials at extremely short delays (corresponding to unnaturally close proximity) had a tendency to accelerate from anticipation. Synchronization lagged at longer delays (larger than usual physical distances) and produced an increasingly severe deceleration and then deterioration of performed rhythms. The study has implications for music collaboration over the Internet and suggests that stable rhythmic performance can be achieved by 'wired ensembles' across distances of thousands of kilometers.},

abstract = {Routers in the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) architecture maintain state for all pending content requests, so as to be able to later return the corresponding content. By employing stateful forwarding, CCN supports native multicast, enhances security and enables adaptive forwarding, at the cost of excessive forwarding state that raises scalability concerns. We propose a semi-stateless forwarding scheme in which, instead of tracking each request at every on-path router, requests are tracked at every d hops. At intermediate hops, requests gather reverse path information, which is later used to deliver responses between routers using Bloom filter-based stateless forwarding. Our approach effectively reduces forwarding state, while preserving the advantages of CCN forwarding. Evaluation results over realistic ISP topologies show that our approach reduces forwarding state by 54{\%}-70{\%} in unicast delivery, without any bandwidth penalties, while in multicast delivery it reduces forwarding state by 34{\%}-55{\%} at the expense of 6{\%}-13{\%} in bandwidth overhead.},

abstract = {This dissertation is a combination of acoustic and electronic musical creation, acoustic instruments and digital instruments, and a combination of all of these areas. Part I is an original composition for orchestra with the new instrument set as soloist. Part II is an examination of the development and influences of creating a new electronic musical instrument. Part I is a composition for AEMI (the Actuated Embedded Musical Instrument) and orchestra, entitled “Meditation on Solids, Liquids, and Gas.” This composition is a dialogue between the orchestra and instrument, set as an exchange of ideas; sometimes ideas lead to conflict, others lead to resolution. This also serves as a way to feature some of the musical capabilities of this new instrument. Part II is an examination of AEMI and its influences. Chapter 1 includes a discussion of existing instruments whose similar features influenced the development of AEMI: the Theremin, Manta, JD-1, Buchla controller, EVI and EWI, and Chameleon Guitar. While AEMI instrument does not have the same performance mechanics as the Theremin, Evi, or Ewi, understanding the physicality issues of an instrument, like the Theremin, provided insights into creating a versatile instrument that can be easily learned yet have virtuosic character. Ultimately, embedding expressivity, such as subtlety and nuance into the instrument, would be one of the most difficult aspects of creating an instrument and would demand the largest amount of work.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) have emerged as a new interface type that interlinks the digital and physical worlds. Drawing upon users' knowledge and skills of interaction with the real non-digital world, TUIs show a potential to enhance the way in which people interact with and leverage digital information. However, TUI research is still in its infancy and extensive research is required in order to fully understand the implications of tangible user interfaces, to develop technologies that further bridge the digital and the physical, and to guide TUI design with empirical knowledge. This monograph examines the existing body of work on Tangible User Interfaces. We start by sketching the history of tangible user interfaces, examining the intellectual origins of this field. We then present TUIs in a broader context, survey application domains, and review frameworks and taxonomies. We also discuss conceptual foundations of TUIs including perspectives from cognitive sciences, psychology, and philosophy. Methods and technologies for designing, building, and evaluating TUIs are also addressed. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of TUIs and chart directions for future research.},

abstract = {Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) are musical instruments typically composed of a control surface where user interaction is measured by sensors whose values are mapped to sound synthesis algorithms. These instruments have gained interest among skilled musicians and performers in the last decades leading to artistic practices including musical performance, interactive installations and dance. The creation of DMIs typically involves several areas, among them: arts, design and engineering. The balance between these areas is an essential task in DMI design so that the resulting instruments are aesthetically appealing, robust, and allow responsive, accurate and repeatable sensing. In this paper, we review the use of sensors in the DMI community as manifested in the proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 2009–2013). Focusing on the sensor technologies and signal conditioning techniques used by the NIME community. Although it has been claimed that specifications for artistic tools are harder than those for military applications, this study raises a paradox showing that in most of the cases, DMIs are based on a few basic sensors types and unsophisticated engineering solutions, not taking advantage of more advanced sensing, instrumentation and signal processing techniques that could dramatically improve their response. We aim to raise awareness of limitations of any engineering solution and to assert the benefits of advanced electronics instrumentation design in DMIs. For this, we propose the use of specialized sensors such as strain gages, advanced conditioning circuits and signal processing tools such as sensor fusion. We believe that careful electronic instrumentation design may lead to more responsive instruments.},

A categorisation helps to elucidate those elements and characteristics that can be applied and looks at how they are perceived by the audience.

Each person monitored the other 's sound via headphones and microphone pickup which was as close as possible. Time delay from source to listener was manipulated across trials. Trials were recorded and clap onset times were measured with an event detection algorithm. Longer delays produced increasingly severe tempo deceleration and shorter delays ({\textless}11.5ms) produced a modest, but surprising acceleration. The study 's goal is to characterize effects of delay on rhythmic accuracy and identify the region most conducive to ensemble playing. The results have implication for networked musical performance. Network delay is a function of transmission distance and/or internetworking (routing) delays. The findings suggest that sensitive ensemble performance can be supported over rather long paths (e.g., San Francisco to Denver at about 20ms, one-way). The finding that moderate amounts of delay are beneficial to tempo stability seems, at first glance, counterintuitive. We discuss the observed effect.},

The semantical point of view, on the other hand, focus on: role of the users, types of actions/gesture/postures to be used for the interaction, goal of the interaction, and role of sound output in the interaction context.
