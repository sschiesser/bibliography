abstract = {1. This study investigated the effects of fatigue, induced by production of maximal isometric force for 60 s with four fingers, upon indices of multifinger co-ordination. 2. Measurements of individual finger forces were performed during single- and multifinger maximal force production (maximal voluntary contraction, MVC) for two sites of force application, the middle of the distal or the middle of the proximal phalanxes. Two fatiguing exercises were used, involving force production at the distal phalanxes and at the proximal phalanxes. Fourteen subjects were tested. 3. The total force in four-finger tasks dropped by about 43 {\%} when it was produced at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise. During force production at the other site, MVC dropped by 23 {\%}. During single-finger MVC tests, force drop with fatigue was similar across all four fingers (about -25 {\%} of their corresponding MVCs). 4. Force production by one finger was accompanied by involuntary force production by other fingers (enslaving). Enslaving remained unchanged by fatigue when measured during force generation at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise, but increased during force production at the other site. 5. The total MVC of four fingers acting in parallel was smaller than the sum of the MVCs of these fingers in single-finger tasks (force deficit). The force deficit increased with fatigue. Force-sharing patterns during four-finger tasks showed only minor changes under fatigue. 6. These results indicate that the effects of fatigue were not limited to changes in the force-generating capabilities of the muscles. In particular, fatigue could lead to a reorganisation at a neural level that defines commands to individual fingers.},

abstract = {This study investigates how controllability of force is influenced by concurrent vibrotactile feedback that is generated proportionally to the applied force. Three different models to provide tactile feedback are introduced: amplitude- and frequency modulation and granular synthesis. Then, an experiment investigating the effect of the feedback models on force control is reported. The tactile feedback conditions were compared to each other and to a condition with no feedback in a force repetition and a force hold tasks. In the force repetition task, all the feedback conditions yielded significantly better accuracy compared to no feedback condition. In the force hold task, there was no difference in the accuracy between the conditions including the no feedback condition. The results suggest that dynamic vibrotactile feedback assists the force control in force repetition tasks.},

abstract = {The difference threshold for the detection of changes in vibration amplitude was measured as a function of the intensity and frequency of stimuli delivered through a 2.9-cm2 contactor to the thenar eminence. Stimuli were either 25- or 250-Hz sinusoids, narrow-band noise centered at 250 Hz, or wideband noise. Thresholds were measured by two-interval, forced-choice tracking under three methods of stimulus presentation. In the gated-pedestal method, subjects had to judge which of two 700-ms bursts of vibration separated by 100 ms was more intense. In the continuous-pedestal method, subjects had to detect a 700-ms increment in the amplitude of an ongoing pedestal of vibration. In the two-burst-continuous-pedestal method with 1500-ms pedestals, the subject had to detect which of two successively presented pedestals contained a 500-ms amplitude increment. Thresholds were consistently lower for detecting increments in the amplitude of a continuous pedestal of vibration than for detecting amplitude differences between briefly presented successive pedestals or amplitude increments in successive pedestals. A "near miss" to Weber's law was found both for sinusoidal and for noise stimuli. The difference threshold was not affected by stimulus frequency condition.},

While there is the difference among individuals, it is well known that the threshold to vibration sensitivity as a function of frequency yields a U-shaped curve that reaches a maximum of sensitivity in the region of 250 Hz as shown in Fig.1. By focusing on this fact, we can evaluate which the vibration sensitivity is changed under the normal condition and the harder skin conditions caused by pressing the proximal phalange of finger forcibly. Through measuring the vibration sensitivity by the psychophysical method, we found that the vibration sensitivity at the frequency of 80 Hz and 120 Hz improves with the statistical significance test (p-value) of below 10 {\%}, but no effect was showed at the frequency of 10 Hz and 30 Hz.},

The four-channel model [J Acoust Soc Am 84 (1988) 1680] has been updated to include measurement over a wider frequency range of tuning of the P and NP I channels, psychophysically determined by forward-masking and adaptation tuning curve methods. In addition to differences in their tuning, the P and NP channels differ in the following ways: (1) the P channel, but not NP channels, has been found to be capable of temporal summation, which operates by neural integration; (2) the capacity for spatial summation is also an exclusive property of the P channel; (3) sensitivity declines with age at a greater rate in the P channel than in the NP channels; (4) the masking or adaptation of a channel has no effect on the sensitivity of the other channels, although the channels interact in the summation of the perceived magnitudes of stimuli presented to separate channels.},

abstract = {The modality of touch encompasses distinct cutaneous, kinesthetic and haptic systems that are distinguished on the basis of the underlying neural inputs. The cutaneous receptors are embedded in the skin; the kinesthetic receptors lie in muscles, tendons, and joints; and the haptic system uses combined inputs from both. Topics in this chapter range from sensory phenomena, such as threshold-level responses, to cognitive and memory processes associated with the haptic system. Haptic perception extracts properties of objects and surfaces that lead to recognition of objects. Material properties are highly accessible, relative to geometric properties, providing a contrast between haptics and vision. The haptic system provides a map of space within reach of the body that provides the basis for recognition of two-dimensional patterns and outline drawings. The spatial map is subject to systematic distortion, particularly as a result of the movements used in exploration. Interactions between haptic and visual perception are described with respect to attention, representation, and memory. As do other modalities, the sense of touch gives rise to implicit and explicit forms of memory. The chapter concludes with applications of research on touch, including aids for the blind and deaf and virtual environments that provide haptic feedback.},

abstract = {Humanhaptic performance is not fixed, but subject to major alterations through learning processes.We describe anewstimulation protocol that allows to improve haptic performance in humans in a highly systemic way through unattended activation-based learning. The so-called coactivation protocol is based upon temporal constraints of Hebbian learning where simultaneity plays a key role for the induction of plastic changes.We provide an overview about the potential of coactivation by summarizing recent findings showing that coactivation alters a broad range of basic as well as cognitively demanding types of haptic performance in parallel to cortical reorganization in somatosensory cortex. For example, coactivation applied to the tip of the index finger, or to all fingers of the dominant hand improves tactile acuity, but also haptic object recognition, and speeds up multiple-choice reaction times. Because such changes persist between 24 h and 1 week without further intervention, we interpret the underlying processes as a particular form of perceptual learning.We describe results where coactivation has been utilized for therapeutical purposes in impaired human populations, we outline new developments to optimize and extend unattended activation-based learning protocols, and we sketch the next steps necessary to apply the concept of unattended activation-based learning on a regular and reliable basis as a therapeutical tool in order to selectively interfere with impaired haptic performance.

In everyday usage, the term does not distinguish between stimulation imposed on us and stimulation that results from our own intentional movement. In this review we consider the nature of touch. However, in our use of the term we include not only skin sensation but also proprioceptive sensation arising in sensory receptors in the muscles (the term "haptics" is sometimes used to refer to the combination of skin and muscle sensory input). We compare and contrast touch that is "passive" (when you are the recipient) and "active" (when your movement is the cause). Our purpose is twofold. First, we seek to describe current understanding of the neurophysiology of a key sensory system. Second, we wish to show how a psychological approach helps us to understand the use of touch information and, to that extent, put the neurophysiology in context.},

The masking stimulus was either a 250‐Hz sinusoid, which was presented in phase with the signal when it was sinusoidal, or noise. Changes in threshold as a function of changes in signal duration were found which were predicted accurately from Zwislocki's theory [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 32, 1046–1060 (1960)] of temporal summation when the signal was detected by the Pacinian channel, but not when it was detected by a non‐Pacinian channel (NP). However, when either the signal or the masking stimulus or both were noise, NP thresholds were affected by changes in signal duration. Only when the signal and masking stimuli were both sinusoids were NP thresholds independent of signal duration. It is concluded that signal duration effects in the NP channel are not due to temporal integration, but rather to increases in information about the signal content provided to the subject as exposure duration is increased.},

This study determined vibration thresholds at four locations on the body with two different contactors so as to assist the identification of the tactile channel determining the threshold at each location. Vibrotactile thresholds at six frequencies from 8 to 250 Hz were measured on the distal phalanx of the index finger, the volar forearm, the large toe, and the heel with two contactors: (i) a 1-mm diameter circular probe with a 1-mm gap to a fixed circular surround (i.e., 7.1-mm(2) excitation area), and (ii) a 6-mm diameter circular probe with a 2-mm gap to a fixed circular surround (i.e., 79-mm(2) excitation area). At all frequencies and with both contactors, thresholds on the fingertip were lower than thresholds on the volar forearm, the large toe, and the heel, consistent with a greater density of mechanoreceptors at the fingertip. Thresholds with the larger contactor were lower than thresholds with the smaller contactor on the fingertip at high frequencies (63, 125, and 250 Hz), on the large toe (except at 250 Hz), on the heel (at all frequencies), and on the volar forearm at 250 Hz. It is concluded that at least two tactile channels (Pacinian from 63 to 250 Hz, and non-Pacinian from 8 to 31.5 Hz) determined vibrotactile thresholds at the fingertip, whereas non-Pacinian channels had a dominant influence on vibrotactile thresholds at the volar forearm. The role of Pacinian and non-Pacinian channels could not be confirmed at the large toe or the heel despite some evidence of spatial summation.},

We propose using human observers to determine if vibrations rendered using a given haptic device are accompanied by artifacts detectable to humans. This determination produces a performance measure that carries particular relevance to applications involving texture rendering. For cases in which a device produces detectable artifacts, we have developed a protocol that localizes deficiencies in device design and/or hardware implementation. In this paper, we present results from human vibration detection experiments carried out using three commercial haptic devices and one high performance voice coil motor. We found that all three commercial devices produced perceptible artifacts when rendering vibrations near human detection thresholds. Our protocol allowed us to pinpoint the deficiencies, however, and we were able to show that minor modifications to the haptic hardware were sufficient to make these devices well suited for rendering vibrations, and by extension, the vibratory components of textures. We generalize our findings to provide quantitative design guidelines that ensure the ability of haptic devices to proficiently render the vibratory components of textures.},

abstract = {To evaluate neurological symptoms in the vibration syndrome, 55 patients with vascular and neurological symptoms in the hand who had been exposed to vibration were examined. Their exposure to vibration was estimated and neurological vascular symptoms were evaluated according to symptom scales. Temperature thresholds were measured on the right thenar eminence and on the distal volar aspect of the second and third fingers held together on both sides. Vibration thresholds were measured dorsally on the second and fifth metacarpal bones and on the second and fifth fingers proximal to the nail roots. Subjects with advanced neurological symptoms had higher temperature and vibration thresholds than subjects with less advanced symptoms. No such relation was found between vascular symptoms and the outcome of sensory testing. Thus neurological but not vascular symptoms are reflected by the outcome of quantitative sensory testing. In subjects with advanced neurological symptoms the tests gave a high proportion of abnormal results, indicating that these tests may be used for the diagnosis of vibration syndrome on an individual basis. Patients with advanced vascular and neurological symptoms had higher exposure dose scores than patients with less advanced symptoms, indicating a dose response relation between vibration "dose" and neurological and vascular symptoms.},

abstract = {Previous experiments performed on monkey and human fingertips suggested that the skin surface and stimulus probe decouple for sinusoidal displacements applied perpendicularly to the skin surface. From these observations, it was concluded that sinusoidal vibration may not be a suitable stimulus for understanding and modeling the tactile system. We repeated these experiments on human observers using stimulus frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 240 Hz and with displacement amplitudes up to 1 mm peak-to-peak (p-p). The skin and probe movements were measured in the steady-state using stroboscopic illumination and video microscopy. Contrary to previous conclusions, we found that decoupling did not occur for amplitudes less then 0.25 mm p-p, regardless of stimulus frequency. Decoupling was only observed for stimulus amplitudes greater than 0.25 mm over the stimulus-frequency range investigated. To further investigate this effect, a modified stimulus contactor was used, which permitted the measurement of the skin's movement using reflected light. Measurements were made on both the index fingertip and the thenar eminence. Regardless of body site, no decoupling between the skin and stimulus probe was observed for frequencies ranging from 20 to 100 Hz up to displacements of 0.25 mm p-p. These levels are well within the range used in most human psychophysical experiments performed on these parts of the body. We conclude that sinusoidal vibration can be used reliably to stimulate the tactile system and is an appropriate stimulus for developing models of touch.},

A minishaker excited the ball in the vertical direction, resulting in vibrations on the skin of the hand in mostly the tangential direction. The position detection threshold curve was similar to that measured earlier using a stylus in the pen-hold posture, but the force detection threshold curve and the mechanical impedance was shifted upwards in the high frequency region. The mechanical impedance at the threshold and suprathreshold levels were essentially the same, indicating that skin characteristics do not change in the dynamic range of tactual perception for the same tool-holding posture},

Also the VPTs of eight pedestal grinders, who were suffering vibration-induced white finger (VWF), were measured in 1979 and 1983. The control group consisted of 20 research workers who had no vibration exposure in the past and no symptoms in their hands. The measuring system for VPT gave repeatable results. The frequency of the most sensitive VPT of vibration exposed workers alternated between 63 and 125 Hz instead of 125 Hz of subjects without vibration exposure. The VPT of the pedestal grinders and forest workers with decreased hand grip force and with vibration-induced white finger were significantly higher than those of the controls. The VPTs of the forest workers decreased slightly and that of the grinders increased from 1979 to 1983. In spite of long vibration exposure in the past and continuing lower level vibration exposure, the increased VPT of forest workers does not seem to be permanent.},

An acute but temporary rise in threshold occurred as a consequence of the vibration exposure in three different unit types (FA I, FA II and SA I). A close correlation was found between the neural and psychophysical thresholds with regard to the magnitudes of the shifts and the time courses of the recovery, provided that the thresholds were measured at the appropriate frequencies (i.e. at 200, 20 and 2 Hz while recording from FA II, FA I and SA I units, respectively).

abstract = {We studied the effects of fatigue of the index finger on indices of force variability in discrete and rhythmic accurate force production tasks performed by the index finger and by all four fingers pressing in parallel. An increase in the variance of the force produced by the fatigued index finger was expected. We hypothesized that the other fingers would also show increased variance of their forces, which would be accompanied by co-variation among the finger forces resulting in relatively preserved accuracy of performance. The subjects performed isometric tasks including maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and accurate force production before and after a 1-min MVC fatiguing exercise by the index finger. During fatigue, there was a significant increase in the root mean square index of force variability during accurate force production by the index finger. In the four-finger tasks, the variance of the individual finger force increased for all four fingers, while the total force variance showed only a modest change. We quantified two components of variance in the space of hypothetical commands to fingers, finger modes. There was a large increase in the variance component that did not affect total force and a much smaller increase in the component that did. The results suggest an adaptive increase in force variance by nonfatigued elements as a strategy to attenuate effects of fatigue on accuracy of multi-element performance. These effects were unlikely to originate at the level of synchronization of motor units across muscle compartments but rather involved higher control levels.},

It modulates the friction of a glass surface by using 39 kHz out-of-plane vibrations to reduce friction. To generate shear forces, the TPaD is oscillated in-plane (i.e., “shivered”) while alternating between low and high friction within each cycle. In previous research, the ShiverPaD produced shear forces using in-plane vibrations below 100 Hz. In this research, we develop a new ShiverPaD that produces force using 854 Hz vibrations, where human sensitivity to vibration is diminished. The new device is used to display a virtual toggle switch and a variety of virtual edges. A human subject study is conducted to demonstrate that users can easily trace virtual edges displayed on the surface of the ShiverPaD.},

However, during the course of our research to develop a full-hand vibrotactile musical communication device for the hearing-impaired, we repeatedly found evidence suggesting sensitivity to higher frequencies. Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators. The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices for music and other applications.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare vibrotactile thresholds between five international test centres, to determine causes of variability, and to provide normative data for use by health professionals. METHODS: Vibrotactile thresholds were measured on various fingers in 1,008 subjects at 31.5 Hz (2,531 measurements) and at 125 Hz (2,807 measurements). Three centres used the up-and-down method of limits, rate of change of stimulus 3dB/s, to obtain vibrotactile thresholds. The push force on the surround was 2 N, the probe contact force was 1 N and the probe diameter was 6 mm concentric to a 10-mm diameter hole in the surround. One centre used an up-and-down method of limits with a 5-dB step and a 1.26-mm diameter probe with no surround. Another centre used a stepping algorithm, no surround, and the force on the 6-mm-diameter probe was unspecified. RESULTS: The 31.5-Hz thresholds and 125-Hz thresholds, expressed in dB, were similar between centres using similar methods. There were small ({\textless}5 dB) differences in vibrotactile thresholds between male and female subjects, between white-collar and blue-collar workers and between fingers. Both 31.5-Hz and 125-Hz thresholds increased with age; the mean effect of age on 31.5-Hz thresholds was approximately 2 dB over 25 years, while the effect of age on 125 Hz-thresholds was as high as 10 dB over 25 years. CONCLUSIONS: Vibrotactile thresholds are influenced by measurement method but can be similar at different centres if similar methods are used. Effects of measurement location and gender are often negligible. Thresholds depend on age, but over the range of ages considered, only the effect on 125-Hz thresholds is sufficient for correction; methods of correcting for age are given. These normative data may be used to assist the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy involving vibrotactile sensation.},

abstract = {Stochastic resonance (SR) occurs when the detection of a subthreshold signal is aided by the presence of random energy fluctuations in the signal modality, commonly called noise. SR is counterintuitive because such noise usually worsens performance. Nonetheless, SR has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally in human sensory systems. Using a psychophysically sophisticated paradigm, we show that SR aids the detection of vibrating touch stimuli presented to the foot soles of both healthy elderly people with elevated vibrotactile thresholds and healthy young people with normal vibrotactile thresholds. The results also suggest that it is possible to know a priori the amount of noise needed for optimal SR effects given the degree to which the signal is subthreshold. Thus, SR may be practical as a rehabilitative aid for individuals with elevated sensory thresholds.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of fatigue, induced by a 60-s maximal isometric force production with the index finger, on multi-finger coordination and force production by the other fingers of the hand. Finger forces were measured during single- and multi-finger maximal voluntary force production (MVC) at two sites, the middle of the distal or the middle of the proximal phalanges. Two fatiguing exercises involving force production by the index finger were used, one at the distal phalanx and the other at the proximal phalanx. The MVC of the index finger dropped by about 33{\%} when it was produced at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise. In addition, large transfer effects of fatigue were observed across sites of force application and across fingers. Force deficit increased under fatigue, especially due to a drop in the recruitment of the index finger. Under fatigue, the index finger was less enslaved during force production by other fingers. During multi-finger tasks, the percentage of total force produced by the index finger was significantly reduced after the fatiguing exercise. The principle of minimization of secondary moments was violated under fatigue. We suggest that the most impaired (fatigued) finger shows less interaction with other fingers or, in other words, is being progressively removed from the multi-finger synergy. Some of the observed changes in finger coordination suggest effects of fatigue at a central (neural) level.},

abstract = {Temporal summation, a decrease in the detection threshold that occurs when either the duration of a stimulus or the number of stimuli in a sequence is increased, has been attributed to the operations of either the mechanism of neural integration or of probability summation. Our experiments indicate that under certain conditions, both mechanisms may operate, but that the process of neural integration is an exclusive characteristic of the Pacinian (P) channel. The P channel was isolated by applying 250 Hz stimuli through a 1.5 cm2 contactor to the thenar eminence of the hand and the NPII channel was isolated by applying the stimuli through a 0.01 cm2 contactor. The finding that the slopes of the psychometric functions were the same within both channels indicated that probability summation could not account for temporal summation for stimulus durations less than 1 s. The finding that the threshold for the detection of multiple-pulse stimuli increased as the interpulse interval increased indicated that, for time intervals less than 800 ms, temporal summation results from neural integration. But for interstimulus intervals greater than 800 ms, probability summation accounts for temporal summation.},

abstract = {Musician's brains constitute an interesting model for neuroplasticity. Imaging studies demonstrated that sensorimotor cortical representations are altered in musicians, which was assumed to arise from the development of skilled performance. However, the perceptual consequences of the cortical changes remain elusive. Here we ask whether cortical reorganization induced by professional musical skill training is paralleled by the evolution of other, unrelated perceptual abilities. We therefore studied psychophysically tactile spatial acuity as an indirect marker of cortical changes in professional pianists and non-musician control subjects using a simultaneous two-point discrimination paradigm. We show that long-lasting piano practising resulted in lower spatial discrimination thresholds in comparison to non-musicians. In musicians, individual discrimination thresholds were linearly correlated with the daily training duration, indicating a direct link between tactile acuity and the degree of piano practising. To investigate whether the superior acuity in pianists is subject to further improvement, we used a Hebbian stimulation protocol of tactile coactivation known to improve spatial tactile acuity. Three hours of coactivation further reduced their discrimination thresholds. The coactivation-induced gain in pianists was significantly larger in comparison to control subjects and correlated with the years of heavy daily practising ({\textgreater}3 h/day), but not with the total years including casual playing. Our results suggest that despite already high-level performance in pianists, Hebbian learning was more effective in musicians than in controls. This implies stronger capacities for plastic reorganization and points to enhanced learning abilities implicating a form of meta-plasticity in professional pianists.},

The present study measured vibrotactile spatial summation at suprathreshold amplitudes. A matching- task was used to investig-ate the effect of varying contactor size on sensory magnitude at three different vibration frequencies. Unlike the threshold data, increasing contactor size resulted in increases in sensory magnitude at 25 and 40 Hz as well as at 160 Hz. The amount of summation varied directly with amplitude for the two lower frequencies. In a second experiment, the effect of increasing static force, independent of contactor size, was investigated. The results indicated that the spatial summation effects noted in the first experiment may be due to increases in static force and not contactor area. The implications of these results for the concept of spatial summation and for the duplex mechanoreceptor hypothesis are discussed.},

abstract = {The effect of fatigue on finger force perception within a hand during ipsilateral finger force matching was examined. Thirteen subjects were instructed to match a reference force of an instructed finger using the same or different finger within the hand before and after index finger fatigue. Absolute reference force targets for the index or little finger were identical during pre- and post-fatigue sessions. Fatigue was induced by a 60-s sustained maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the index finger. Index finger MVC decreased approximately 29{\%}, while there was a non-significant (about 5{\%}) decrease in the little finger MVC. The results showed that: (1) the absolute reference and matching forces of the instructed fingers were not significantly changed after fatigue, while the total forces (sum of instructed and uninstructed finger forces) were increased after fatigue. (2) The relative forces (with respect to corresponding pre- and post-fatigue MVCs) of the index finger increased significantly in both reference and matching tasks, while the relative forces of the little finger remained unchanged after fatigue. (3) Matching errors remained unchanged after fatigue when the fatigued index finger produced the reference force, while the errors increased significantly when the fatigued index finger produced the matching force. (4) Enslaving (difference between total and instructed finger forces) increased significantly after fatigue, especially during force production by the fatigued index finger and when the little finger produced matching forces at higher force levels. (5) Enslaving significantly increased matching errors particularly after fatigue. Taken together, our results suggest that absolute finger forces within the hand are perceived within the CNS during ipsilateral finger force matching. Perception of absolute forces of the fatigued index finger is not altered after fatigue. The ability of the fatigued index finger to reproduce little finger forces is impaired to a certain degree, however. The impairment is likely to be attributable to altered afferent/efferent relationships of the fatigued index finger.},

abstract = {The effects of various conditions, including temporary threshold shifts (TTS) induced by exposure to vibration on vibration sense thresholds, have been investigated. The vibration sense thresholds of five subjects were measured on the middle fingertip of the left hand. A contactor with a diameter of 7 mm was surrounded by three alternative plates with holes of different sizes. The contact force was controlled at either 1 N, 2 N, or 3 N. For the TTS test, the left hand was exposed to vibration at 20 ms-2 rms for five minutes. The frequencies of both the exposure to vibration and the vibration threshold test were in the range 16 Hz to 500 Hz. Using a surround around the contactor greatly reduced the vibration sense threshold at 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz but increased the threshold at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz. An effect of contact force was seen only at the higher frequencies; larger contact forces led to lower thresholds at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz. As temperature of the finger skin decreased, the vibration thresholds increased, with the changes at higher frequencies greater than those at lower frequencies. The TTS at 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz measured 0.5 minutes after exposure to vibration (TTS0.5) were highest after exposures to vibration at lower frequencies. The TTS0.5 at 63 Hz was similar after exposure to all frequencies. The TTS0.5 values at 125 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz were highest after exposures to vibration at 125 Hz and 250 Hz. It was apparent that the physiological characteristics of vibration sensation at low and high frequencies differed significantly. These findings suggest that two representative frequencies can be used when evaluation the neurological effects of occupational exposures to vibration by means of vibration sense thresholds.},

abstract = {We investigated the gating effect of passive and active movement on the vibrotactile detection thresholds of the Pacinian (P) psychophysical channel and forward masking. Previous work on gating mostly used electrocutaneous stimulation and did not allow focusing on tactile submodalities. Ten healthy adults participated in our study. Passive movement was achieved by swinging a platform, on which the participant's stimulated hand was attached, manually by a trained operator. The root-mean-square value of the movement speed was kept in a narrow range (slow: 10-20 cm/s, fast: 50-60 cm/s). Active movement was performed by the participant him-/herself using the same apparatus. The tactile stimuli consisted of 250-Hz sinusoidal mechanical vibrations, which were generated by a shaker mounted on the movement platform and applied to the middle fingertip. In the forward-masking experiments, a high-level masking stimulus preceded the test stimulus. Each movement condition was tested separately in a two-interval forced-choice detection task. Both passive and active movement caused a robust gating effect, that is, elevation of thresholds, in the fast speed range. Statistically significant change of thresholds was not found in slow movement conditions. Passive movement yielded higher thresholds than those measured during active movement, but this could not be confirmed statistically. On the other hand, the effect of forward masking was approximately constant as the movement condition varied. These results imply that gating depends on both peripheral and central factors in the P channel. Active movement may have some facilitatory role and produce less gating. Additionally, the results support the hypothesis regarding a critical speed for gating, which may be relevant for daily situations involving vibrations transmitted through grasped objects and for manual exploration.},

abstract = {Although previous physiological and anatomical experiments have identified four afferent fiber types (PC, RA, SA II, and SA I) in glabrous (nonhairy) skin of the human somatosensory periphery, only three have been shown to mediate tactile (mechanoreceptive) sensation. Psychophysical evidence that four channels (P, NP I, NP II, and NP III) do, indeed, participate in the perceptual process is presented. In a series of experiments involving selective masking of the various channels, modification of the skin-surface temperature, and testing cutaneous sensitivity down to very low-vibratory frequencies, the fourth psychophysical channel (NP III) is defined. Based on these experiments and previous work from our laboratory, it is concluded that the four channels work in conjunction at threshold to create an operating range for the perception of vibration that extends from at least 0.4 to greater than 500 Hz. Each of the four channels appears to mediate specific portions of the overall threshold-frequency characteristic. Selection of appropriate neural-response criteria from previously published physiological data and correlation of their derived frequency characteristics with the four psychophysical channels indicates that each channel has its own physiological substrate: P channel and PC fibers, NP I channel and RA fibers, NP II channel and SA II fibers, and NP III channel and SA I fibers. These channels partially overlap in their absolute sensitivities, making it likely that suprathreshold stimuli may activate two or more of the channels at the same time. Thus the perceptual qualities of touch may be determined by the combined inputs from four channels.},

We consider the possibility that passive-guided conditions, as used in most active-passive comparisons, are relatively free from cognitive decision-making, while active conditions involve cognitive loads that are quite high and uncharacteristic of normal sensory processes. Thus studies that purport to show differences in active and passive touch may instead be revealing differences in the amount of cognition involved in active and passive tasks. We hypothesized that passive-guided conditions reduce not the sensory load but the cognitive load that active explorers must bear. To test this hypothesis Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) activity was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during active and passive-guided fingertip exploration of 2D raised line drawings. Active movements resulted in greater activation (compared with passive movements) in areas implicated in higher order processes such as monitoring and controlling of goal-directed behavior, attention, execution of movements, and error detection. Passive movements, in contrast, produced greater BOLD activity in areas associated with touch perception, length discrimination, tactile object recognition, and efference copy. The activation of a greater number of higher-order processing areas during active relative to passive-guided exploration suggests that instances of passive-guided superiority may not be due to the haptic system's limited ability to cope with sensory inputs, but rather the restriction imposed by the use of a single finger such that active exploration may require cognitive strategies not demanded in the passive condition. Our findings suggest that previous attempts to compare active and passive touch have, in order to simplify tasks, inadvertently introduced cognitive load at the expense of normal sensory inputs.},

abstract = {Extensive training of repetitive and highly skilled movements, as it occurs in professional classical musicians, may lead to changes in tactile sensitivity and corresponding cortical reorganization of somatosensory cortices. It is also known that professional musicians frequently experience musculoskeletal pain and pain-related symptoms during their careers. The present study aimed at understanding the complex interaction between chronic pain and music training with respect to somatosensory processing. For this purpose, tactile thresholds (mechanical detection, grating orientation, two-point discrimination) and subjective ratings to thermal and pressure pain stimuli were assessed in 17 professional musicians with chronic pain, 30 pain-free musicians, 20 non-musicians with chronic pain, and 18 pain-free non-musicians. We found that pain-free musicians displayed greater touch sensitivity (i.e., lower mechanical detection thresholds), lower tactile spatial acuity (i.e., higher grating orientation thresholds) and increased pain sensitivity to pressure and heat compared to pain-free non-musicians. Moreover, we also found that musicians and non-musicians with chronic pain presented lower tactile spatial acuity and increased pain sensitivity to pressure and heat compared to pain-free non-musicians. The significant increment of pain sensitivity together with decreased spatial discrimination in pain-free musicians and the similarity of results found in chronic pain patients, suggests that the extensive training of repetitive and highly skilled movements in classical musicians could be considered as a risk factor for developing chronic pain, probably due to use-dependent plastic changes elicited in somatosensory pathways.},

abstract = {The neural mechanisms behind active and passive touch are not yet fully understood. Using fMRI we investigated the brain correlates of these exploratory procedures using a roughness categorization task. Participants either actively explored a surface (active touch) or the surface was moved under the participant's stationary finger (passive touch). The stimuli consisted of three different grades of sandpaper which participants were required to categorize as either coarse, medium, or fine. Exploratory procedure did not affect performance although the coarse and fine surfaces were more easily categorized than the medium surface. An initial whole brain analysis revealed activation of sensory and cognitive areas, including post-central gyrus and prefrontal cortical areas, in line with areas reported in previous studies. Our main analysis revealed greater activation during active than passive touch in the contralateral primary somatosensory region but no effect of stimulus roughness. In contrast, activation in the parietal operculum (OP) was significantly affected by stimulus roughness but not by exploration procedure. Active touch also elicited greater and more distributed brain activity compared with passive touch in areas outside the somatosensory region, possibly due to the motor component of the task. Our results reveal that different cortical areas may be involved in the processing of surface exploration and surface texture, with exploration procedures affecting activations in the primary somatosensory cortex and stimulus properties affecting relatively higher cortical areas within the somatosensory system.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of extended suprathreshold vibratory stimulation on the sensitivity of slowly adapting type 1 (SA1), rapidly adapting (RA), and Pacinian (PC) afferents. To that end, an algorithm was developed to track afferent absolute (I0) and entrainment (I1) thresholds as they change over time. We recorded afferent responses to periliminal vibratory test stimuli, which were interleaved with intense vibratory conditioning stimuli during the adaptation period of each experimental run. From these measurements, the algorithm allowed us to infer changes in the afferents' sensitivity. We investigated the stimulus parameters that affect adaptation by assessing the degree to which adaptation depends on the amplitude and frequency of the adapting stimulus. For all three afferent types, I0 and I1 increased with increasing adaptation frequency and amplitude. The degree of adaptation seems to be independent of the firing rate evoked in the afferent by the conditioning stimulus. In the analysis, we distinguished between additive adaptation (in which I0 and I1 shift equally) and multiplicative effects (in which the ratio I1/I0 remains constant). RA threshold shifts are almost perfectly additive. SA1 threshold shifts are close to additive and far from multiplicative (I1 threshold shifts are twice the I0 shifts). PC shifts are more difficult to classify. We used an integrate-and-fire model to study the possible neural mechanisms. A change in transducer gain predicts a multiplicative change in I0 and I1 and is thus ruled out as a mechanism underlying SA1 and RA adaptation. A change in the resting action potential threshold predicts equal, additive change in I0 and I1 and thus accounts well for RA adaptation. A change in the degree of refractoriness during the relative refractory period predicts an additional change in I1 such as that observed for SA1 fibers. We infer that adaptation is caused by an increase in spiking thresholds produced by ion flow through transducer channels in the receptor membrane. In a companion paper, we describe the time-course of vibratory adaptation and recovery for SA1, RA, and PC fibers.},

@article{Chapman1994,
abstract = {Active and passive touch, respectively with and without voluntary movement on the part of the subject, are frequently reported to be equivalent in terms of the resultant perceptual abilities. This review reexamines the notion of perceptual equivalence in the light of growing evidence that the transmission of tactile inputs is diminished, or "gated," during the course of active movement. It is concluded that there is indeed gating of cutaneous inputs during active touch. In most experiments, the paradoxical observation of perceptual equivalence between active and passive touch can partly be explained by the choice of task, namely, tactile discriminations that depend on relative, and not absolute, differences in inputs. The surprising lack of evidence for any superiority of passive touch over active touch can likely be explained by several factors. First, performance with active touch may be enhanced by the motor strategy, e.g., by reducing the speed of movement at critical points, and so reducing the degree of gating, and (or) by optimally orienting the exploring digits so as to bring the most sensitive skin areas into contact with the object in question. Second, central influences, including attention and motor set, may be specifically activated during voluntary movement and contribute to enhancing performance during active touch. Thus, the gating influences associated with active touch may be offset, partly or wholly, by the combined influence of these factors to yield (near) perceptual equivalence for active and passive touch.},

abstract = {A novel sensory substitution technique is presented. Kinesthetic and cutaneous force feedback are substituted by cutaneous feedback only, provided by two wearable devices able to apply forces to the index finger and the thumb, while holding a handle during a teleoperation task. The force pattern, fed back to the user while using the cutaneous devices, is similar, in terms of intensity and area of application, to the cutaneous force pattern applied to the finger pad while interacting with a haptic device providing both cutaneous and kinesthetic force feedback. The pattern generated using the cutaneous devices can be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic feedback and the kinesthetic part of it. For this reason, we refer to this approach as sensory subtraction instead of sensory substitution. A needle insertion scenario is considered to validate the approach. The haptic device is connected to a virtual environment simulating a needle insertion task. Experiments show that the perception of inserting a needle using the cutaneous-only force feedback is nearly indistinguishable from the one felt by the user while using both cutaneous and kinesthetic feedback. Asmost of the sensory substitution approaches, the proposed sensory subtraction technique also has the advantage of not suffering from stability issues of teleoperation systems due, for instance, to communication delays. Moreover, experiments show that the sensory subtraction technique outperforms sensory substitution with more conventional visual feedback.},

For higher values of these parameters, it strongly depends on both.

abstract = {1. Subjects without any previous experience in a tactile psychophysics task participated in a study of tactile letter recognition employing active and passive touch. In the active task, subjects reached through a curtain and examined embossed letters with horizontal, unidirectional finger strokes. In the passive task, subjects sat with their arms and hands immobilized while a rotating drum stimulator pressed the embossed letters onto the right index finger. The stimulus conditions in the passive task were identical to those used in neurophysiological experiments with monkeys. 2. A survey of 40 naive subjects who were not screened in any way showed a wide range of performance levels. There was no difference between the subjects in the active and passive tasks, either in overall mean percent correct scores, which were 49.0 and 50.7{\%}, respectively or in the percent correct scores for individual letters whose product-moment correlation coefficient was 0.94. The active and passive groups, which contained 25 and 15 members, respectively, had no members in common. 3. Videotapes of the finger movements of eight subjects in the active task showed a characteristic V-shaped velocity profile (velocity vs. lateral position) starting at approximately 100 mm/s at the left-hand edge of the plate containing the embossed letter, decelerating to a minimum when the center of the finger was directly over the letter, and then accelerating away from the letter. The average minimum scanning velocity was 17 mm/s. 4. Scanning velocity had no significant effect on performance in the passive task between 20 and 40 mm/s. An increase to 80 mm/s produced a 16{\%} decline in percent correct identifications. 5. Learning effects were evident across sessions even though subjects were given no feedback or training. The increase in mean percent correct judgments averaged 4{\%} per session, which lasted for approximately 1 h. 6. Data from 64 subjects were pooled for detailed comparison of identification patterns in active and passive touch. The results were analyzed and found to be consistent with the hypothesis that the identification and confusion probabilities are identical in the two modes. We conclude that there is no difference between active and passive touch in form recognition when the stimulus pattern is smaller than a finger pad. 7. Data from all experiments were pooled to produce a single confusion matrix with 324 presentations per letter. The majority of erroneous responses are grouped in a small number of confusion pairs and the majority of those confusion pairs are strongly asymmetric. The probable neural mechanisms of some confusion patterns are discussed.},

abstract = {Wearability will significantly increase the use of haptics in everyday life, as has already happened for audio and video technologies. The literature on wearable haptics is mainly focused on vibrotactile stimulation, and only recently, wearable devices conveying richer stimuli, like force vectors, have been proposed. This paper introduces design guidelines for wearable haptics and presents a novel 3-DoF wearable haptic interface able to apply force vectors directly to the fingertip. It consists of two platforms: a static one, placed on the back of the finger, and a mobile one, responsible for applying forces at the finger pad. The structure of the device resembles that of parallel robots, where the fingertip is placed in between the static and the moving platforms. This work presents the design of the wearable display, along with the quasi-static modeling of the relationship between the applied forces and the platform's orientation and displacement. The device can exert up to 1.5 N, with a maximum platform inclination of 30 degree. To validate the device and verify its effectiveness, a curvature discrimination experiment was carried out: employing the wearable device together with a popular haptic interface improved the performance with respect of employing the haptic interface alone.},

@article{LamoreKeemink:VibesThreshForce,
abstract = {The shape of the psychophysical frequency threshold curve for vibrations presented to the skin in the frequency region 5-1000 Hz is strongly dependent on the static force that the vibrator exerts on the skin and on whether there is a rigid surround around the vibrating contactor (presence of contrast). Where there is no rigid surround, an increase in static force reduces the threshold in the high-frequency region and increases it at low frequencies. When the static forces are sufficiently large, the thresholds reach a minimum value above 30 Hz and a maximum one below 30 Hz, this being the crossover frequency. Under these conditions in the frequency region around 200 Hz, where the threshold is determined by the Pacini receptor system, the vibration sensitivities of finger pad and thenar eminence (glabrous skin) are equal, while the value for the inner side of the forearm (hairy skin) is 12 dB higher. However, when a rigid surround is used, the threshold increases above 30 Hz and decreases below 30 Hz. The latter increase in sensitivity, which is introduced by the presence of contrast cues, amounts to about 20 dB and is sharply tuned at 18 Hz for the glabrous skin of the finger. It is argued that in this case the threshold is determined by the Meissner receptor system. This increase in sensitivity is less pronounced (about 10 dB) and less sharply tuned for the other sites. Finally, when the contact of the vibrating surface to the skin is at a minimum, the vibration threshold has the same displacement value (about 3 microns) over the whole frequency region independent of the site of stimulation and whether or not a rigid surround is present.},

abstract = {Maximum isometric finger-grip forces were predicted using a biomechanical model for plane motion of the middle finger. In the course of this study, mathematical representations of tendon displacement, the moment arm of tendon at the finger joints and muscle force-length relationship were investigated. The information gathered was applied to the model to estimate the maximum grip force of the middle finger gripping cylinders of different sizes. Muscle force per unit physiological cross-section area of 30 N/cm2 resulted in good agreement with measured force. However, for finger postures having an acute proximal interphalangeal joint angle, the estimated force was greater than that measured. Various joint angles were applied to the model to simulate the wrist and finger postures not limited to the cylinder grip. In general the finger force was greatest with the wrist in its extended position and at acute flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The maximum finger force occurred at reduced metacarpophalangeal joint angles as the wrist joint changed from an extended position to a flexed one. It is also postulated that muscle force-length relationship is an important factor in muscle force predictions. The data obtained by this research are useful for the design of handles and the current model is applicable to the analysis of hand postures for workers using hand tools.},

To this end, we ran an experiment where participants had to steer a path with the stylus through a curved corridor on the surface of a graphic tablet/display, and we measured steering time, dispersion of trajectories, and applied force. Despite the variety of subjective impressions elicited by the different feedback conditions, we found that only nonvisual feedback induced significant variations in trajectories and an increase in movement time. In a post-experiment, using a paper-and-wood physical realization of the same texture, we recorded a variety of gestural behaviors markedly different from those found with the virtual texture. With the physical setup, movement time was shorter and texture-dependent lateral accelerations could be observed. This work highlights the limits of multisensory pseudo-haptic techniques in the exploration of surface textures.},

abstract = {When using vibrotactile thresholds to investigate neuropathy in the fingers, the indentation of a vibrating probe, and the force applied to a static surround around a vibrating probe, affect thresholds. This study was designed to investigate the effects on vibrotactile perception thresholds at the sole of the foot of probe indentation (i.e. height of a vibrating probe relative to a static surround) and the force applied to the static surround. Thresholds at 20 Hz (expected to be mediated by the NP I channel) and at 160 Hz (expected to be mediated by the Pacinian channel) were obtained at the hallux (i.e. greater toe) and the ball of the foot on 14 healthy subjects. In one condition, the height of the vibrating probe was varied to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm above a static surround with 4-N force applied to the surround. In a second condition, the force applied to the surround was varied to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 N while using a probe height of 1mm. Thresholds at 20 Hz decreased with increasing probe height from 0 to 1 mm but showed no significant variation between 2, 3, and 4mm at either the hallux or the ball of the foot. Thresholds at 160 Hz decreased with increasing probe height from 0 to 4 mm at both the hallux and the ball of the foot. Thresholds at 20 Hz obtained with 1-N surround force were higher than thresholds obtained with 2 N, but there was no significant difference with surround forces from 2 to 6 N at either the hallux or the ball of the foot. Thresholds at 160 Hz were unaffected by variations in surround force at the ball of the foot but tended to decrease with increasing force at the hallux. It is concluded that a vibrating probe flush with a static surround, and a surround force in the range 2-4 N, are appropriate when measuring vibrotactile thresholds at the hallux and the ball of the foot with a 6-mm diameter contactor and a 2-mm gap to the static surround.},

abstract = {A series of experiments are described in which magnitude estimates of the perceived size of steel balls were made when the balls were actively rolled between the fingertip and several other body sites (thumb, thenar eminence, forearm). This movement, called scripting, involves actively moving an object by a touching surface over another surface of the body which is passively being touched. We define this active/passive activity as "intra-active touch" and the results show that the perceptual size of the balls is dependent upon the body part passively being activated. An additional series of experiments decoupled the actively generated and passively received tactile information by having subjects either perform the scripting on another individual's body site or by having the other individual roll the balls on the subject's various sites. The latter experiments showed that the passive body can contribute to the overall impression of the size of the balls, but only when the intra-active touching involved the glabrous skin of the hands. Intra-active touch between the active finger and the passively touched hairy skin of the forearm showed no effect of the touched surface on the perceived size of the balls. The results suggest that the mechanisms of intra-active touch are different when glabrous skin activates glabrous skin than when glabrous skin activates hairy skin. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Tactile stimulation usually occurs as a combination of an active movement (reaching out to touch a surface) and a sensation (actually feeling the surface against the skin). The brain has information about the active component (the motor command) before it occurs because of efference copy, while the passive component must be transduced before it can be processed. Since the active and passive tactile components are available to the brain at different times, determining the time of touch requires calculation worked backwards from the passive sensation, and/or worked forward from the active motor command. In order to determine which touch process is perceived more quickly, we varied the relative delay between an active and a passive touch signal and determined the relative time percieved as simultaneous. A passive touch needed to be presented before an active key was pressed in order for the two touches to be perceived as simultaneous, but this timing difference was not significant. In order to test the plasticity of the active and passive touch systems, we exploited the fact that the point of subjective simultaneity between two stimuli can sometimes be altered by repeated exposure to asynchronous presentation. We exposed subjects to an active key press/ passive touch pair delayed by 250 ms. This exposure increased the range of relative delays between active and passive touches at which the pairs were judged as simultaneous. This is consistent with an adaptive change in the processing of active touch. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Based on recent discoveries of stretch and voltage activated ion channels in the receptive area of the Pacinian Corpuscle (PC), this paper describes a two-stage mechanotransduction model of its near threshold Vibrotactile (VT) sensitivity valid over 10 Hz to a few kHz. The model is based on the nonlinear and stochastic behavior of the ion channels represented as dependent charge sources loaded with membrane impedance. It simulates the neural response of the PC considering the morphological and statistical properties of the receptor potential and action potential with the help of an adaptive relaxation pulse frequency modulator. This model also simulates the plateaus and nonmonotonic saturation of spike rate characteristics. The stochastic simulation based on the addition of mechanical and neural noise describes that the VT Sensitivity Threshold (VTST) at higher frequencies is more noise dependent. Above 800 Hz even a SNR = 150 improves the neurophysiological VTST more than 3 dB$\mu$. In that frequency range, an absence of the entrainment threshold and a lower sensitivity index near the absolute threshold make the upper bound of the psychophysical VTST more dependent on the experimental protocol and physical set-up. This model can be extended to simulate the neural response of a group of PCs.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method of estimating fingertip forces in finger tapping movements based on human fingerpad characteristics. Since the human fingerpad exhibits elasticity, the proposed technique recreates the relationship between the fingertip force and the displacement generated between the thumb and index fingerpads as a fingerpad-stiffness model. Then, using this model, the force between the two fingertips (the fingertip force) can be estimated from the measured fingerpad deformation only. As the method does not require any sensors to be attached to the finger contact surface to measure fingertip force, it can be used to evaluate the tendency of force in natural and unconstrained finger tapping movements conducted by the subject. In the experiments conducted, fingertip forces and the displacement of the two fingerpads generated when the subjects pinched and pushed a force sensor with the thumb and index finger were measured to approximate the relationships between fingerpad force and deformation. The results indicated that human fingerpad characteristics can be expressed using a fingerpad-stiffness function (including an exponential function), and that fingerpad forces can be estimated using the proposed model. Furthermore, comparison between a Parkinson's disease (PD) patient and a healthy subject confirmed differences in the finger tapping forces for each. This implies the possibility of assessing motor function in PD patients using the finger tapping force evaluation method proposed in this paper.},

abstract = {Brisben, A. J., S. S. Hsiao, and K. O. Johnson. Detection of vibration transmitted through an object grasped in the hand. A tool or probe often functions as an extension of the hand, transmitting vibrations to the hand to produce a percept of the object contacting the tool or probe. This paper reports the psychophysical results of a combined psychophysical and neurophysiological study of the perception of vibration transmitted through a cylinder grasped in the hand. In the first part of the psychophysical study, 19 subjects grasped a cylinder, 32 mm diam, with an embedded motor that caused vibration parallel to the axis of the cylinder. The relationship between threshold and frequency was the traditional U-shaped function with a minimum between 150 and 200 Hz. Except a study by Bekesy in which subjects grasped a rod that vibrated parallel to the skin surface, thresholds above 20 Hz were lower and the slopes were steeper than any reported previously. Thresholds were {\textless}0.01 {\{}micro{\}}m in some subjects. Data from both the psychophysical and the neurophysiological studies suggest that detection performance at frequencies {\textgreater}20 Hz was based on activity in Pacinian afferents. The extreme sensitivity compared with previous reports may have resulted from differences in contact area, direction of vibration, contact force, and the shape of the stimulus probe. The effects of each of these variables were studied. At 40 and 300 Hz (frequencies near the lower and upper end of the Pacinian range) thresholds were 9.8 and 18.5 dB (68 and 88{\%}) lower, respectively, when subjects grasped the cylinder than when a 1-mm-diam probe vibrated perpendicular to the skin. These differences were accounted for as follows: 1) thresholds at a single fingerpad obtained with the large cylindrical surface were, on average, 20 and 60{\%} lower, respectively, than thresholds with the punctate probe; 2) thresholds at the palm were, on average, 15 and 40{\%} lower, respectively, than at the fingerpads; 3) thresholds obtained when the subjects grasped the cylinder averaged 40 and 20{\%} less, respectively, than when the cylinder contacted only the palm; 4) thresholds with the cylinder contacting two fingers were 10 and 30{\%} lower, respectively, than thresholds with the cylinder contacting a single finger; and 5) thresholds with vibration parallel to the skin surface were, on average, 10 and 30{\%} lower, respectively, than thresholds with vibration perpendicular to the skin. Contact force, which was varied from 0.05 to 1.0 N, had no effect.},

{\%} (NB they had only 4 subjects!) Four more experiments were performed to determine how contact area, contact force (PASSIVE), direction of vibration, and the shape of the contactor affect this performance at low (40 Hz) and high (300 Hz) frequencies within the range served by Pacinian mechanisms. Except contact force, each of these factors affected detection performance. 
{\%} Considered contact forces (PASSIVE): 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 N. Because the forces that we and others (Lamore and Keemink 1988; Verrillo 1962) have used in psychophysical experiments are two to three orders of magnitude lower than forces that may occur in manual tasks, extending these investigations to higher forces is important. Increasing force beyond 1–2 N could lower thresholds by coupling transmitted vibrations to bones and tendons that might transmit the vibrations more effectively to distant Pacinian corpuscles. 
{\%} To determine whether there is a difference between perceptual capacity in active and passive touch, the stimulus conditions must be identical in the two conditions. Under these circumstances, the result has been either that the perceptual capacity is the same in the two circumstances (Vega-Bermudez et al. 1991) or that it is superior in the passive condition (Magee and Kennedy 1980). The explanation advanced for the latter finding is that active touch requires division of attention between the sensory and motor tasks (Magee and Kennedy 1980).},

abstract = {This paper analyzes fingertip behavior on sticky surfaces for synthesizing stickiness sensation. Changes of fingertip contact area were monitored during contacts to sticky surfaces, which were then analyzed with respect to contact force. The analysis revealed that stickiness sur- faces cause large hysteresis on the relationship between contact force and area. Based on the analysis, the sticky sensation was simply synthesized by using vacuum pressure. The synthesized sensation elicited a similar feeling as sticky sensation caused by adhesive glue, although the sensa- tion was weaker than the intended one.},

@article{Yokoyama2009a,
abstract = {Changes in auditory sensitivity were recorded with a B{\'{e}}k{\'{e}}sy audiometer technique following exposure to vibration in each of 300 cpm (5 Hz) and 1000 cpm (16.7 Hz), to broad-band noise of 82 dB SL and to both. Vibration at a frequency of 300 cpm and an amplitude of 6 mm, or at a frequency of 1000 cpm and an amplitude of 3 mm, were applied until the subject could no longer tolerate them (a 20 min period) by a noise-controlled vibration exciter. There was no significant change in threshold sensitivity after exposure to vibration alone. Exposure to vibration and noise simultaneously caused greater threshold shifts (TTS) and longer recovery time than exposure to noise alone. This was especially true with 1000 cpm vibration. It was suggested that the effects of the combined noise and vibration might be the results of some disturbances of physiological homeostasis or possible mechanical interactions with its blood supply.

@article{Gibson:ActiveTouch,
abstract = {"A series of observations, both introspective and behavioral, confirms the distinction between touching and being touched. The former is a channel for a great variety of information about the environment, but whether it should be considered one or several senses is a matter of definition. The simple formula that it consists of passive touch plus kinesthesis is insufficient. The hypothesis of two components of stimulation, one exterospecific and one propriospecific, is more promising."},

@inproceedings{PianoVib:SMC2014,
abstract = {An experiment has been conducted, measuring pianists' sensitivity to piano key vibrations at the fingers while playing an upright or a grand Yamaha Disklavier piano. At each trial, which consisted in playing loud and long A notes across the whole keyboard, vibrations were either present or absent through setting the Disklavier pianos to normal or quiet mode. Sound feedback was always pro- vided by a MIDI controlled piano synthesizer via isolating ear/headphones, which masked the acoustic sound in nor- mal mode. In partial disagreement with the existing liter- ature, our results suggest that significant vibrotactile cues are produced in the lower range of the piano keyboard, with perceptual cut-off around the middle octave. Possible psy- chophysical mechanisms supporting the existence of such cues are additionally discussed.},

@article{Yao2010c,
abstract = {This paper addresses the question of strength perception for vibration signals used in mobile devices. Employing devices similar to standard cell phones and using pulsed vibration signals to combat adaptation effects, experiments were performed to study the effect of weight and underlying vibration frequency on perceived strength. Results shows that for the same measured acceleration on the device, a heavier box is perceived to vibrate with greater strength. Furthermore, signals with higher underlying frequency are perceived to be weaker for the same measured acceleration. While our results are consistent with previous studies, they are obtained for the specific condition of ungrounded, vibrating objects held in the hand. Our results suggest the need for a systematic correction law for use by designers to specify the vibratory characteristics of a device as a function of its weight and of the desired operating frequency.},
