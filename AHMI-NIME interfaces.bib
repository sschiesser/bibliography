abstract = {The development of the cushion-like musical interface called the sponge started about seven years ago. Since then, it was extensively used to perform in various settings. The sponge itself is described, but the main focus is on the evolution of the mapping strategies that are used. The author reviews the guidelines proposed by other researchers and explains how they were concretely applied with the sponge. He concludes that no single strategy constitutes a solution to the issue of mapping and that musical compositions are complex entities that require the use of a multitude of mapping strategies in parallel. It is hoped that the mappings described combined with new strategies will eventually lead to the emergence of a musical language that is idiomatic to the sponge.},

@inproceedings{WyseAl2012:PalmAreaVibes,
abstract = {The upper limit of frequency sensitivity for vibrotactile stimulation of the fingers and hand is commonly accepted as 1 kHz. However, during the course of our research to develop a full-hand vibrotactile musical communication device for the hearing-impaired, we repeatedly found evidence suggesting sensitivity to higher frequencies. Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators. The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices for music and other applications.},

{\%} Discussion: 
{\%} - large contact area of the whole hand (palm and fingers) facilitated spatial integration of vibrotactile stimuli, leading to lower detection thresholds for higher frequencies.

{\%} - complex stimuli: suggest an explanation beyond simple integration across frequency, and point to the possibility that the temporal dynamics of complex signals could play a role in detecting vibrotactile stimulation.},

Building on previous work developing a DMI with integrated vibrotactile feedback actuators, we discuss how to produce instrument-like vibrations, compare these simulated vibrations with those produced by an acoustic instrument and examine how the integration of this feedback effects performer ratings of the instrument. We found that integrated vibrotactile feedback resulted in an increase in performer engagement with the instrument, but resulted in a reduction in the perceived control of the instrument. We discuss these results and their implications for the design of new digital musical instruments.},

@phdthesis{Pedrosa2007,
abstract = {When designing haptic feedback into human-computer interfaces the most common approach is to restrict its deployment to only one of the haptic channels (either force or vibrotactile feedback) and this decision is often biased according to the technological boundaries imposed by the interface design or its purpose. The research presented here outlines a methodology developed to include haptic feedback in a gesture interface used to implement a computer based music instrument. The primary goal of this research is to achieve an increased understanding of how different flavors of haptic feedback should be combined to support both controllability and comfort in expressive interfaces such as computer based musical instruments. The work reported here has two parts: 1) a description of an initial user experiment conducted for the purpose of assessing the use of vibrotactile stimuli as rhythmic cues, and 2) a proposed research trajectory which will constitute the theme for a PhD project. The main hypothesis guiding this research is that the best way to include haptic feedback into any design should start by understanding the role each haptic channel plays in the “real life scenario”. The assumption we will put into test is that the feedback provided for each haptic channel could be developed individually and later on fine tuned when mixed in the final design, and this includes that the addition of any extra cues we might be interested in supplying to the end user to enhance the real life experience should be designed and mixed in each haptic channel before the final blend occurs. This methodology could be defined as a “perception-based design”: a design approach that starts with a perceptual characterization of the interaction that is being addressed and fine tune the results according to the perceptual load put on the user senses. We expect that the knowledge gathered will be useful not only to a broader spectrum of expressive interfaces but could also be extrapolated to including haptic feedback in other interface designs.},

abstract = {This paper investigates whether a dynamic vibrotactile feedback improves the playability of a gesture controlled virtual instrument. The instrument described in this study is based on a virtual control surface that player strikes with a hand held sensor-actuator device. We designed two tactile cues to augment the stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface. We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance. In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all. The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument.},
