abstract = {This paper presents a study of gestural control applied to sound synthesis. It discusses an implementation of real- time gestural control of the CHANT software (Max/MSP). The input device consists of a Wacom graphic tablet instrumented with additional sensors. A study has been carried out on the selection of transducer technologies to match the available synthesis parameters, based on existing literature. In order to prove the validity of previous studies, different user tests have been devised and implemented. User reactions were annotated and further evaluated. An exploratory analysis of the tests' results is presented which tends to validate previous works.},

abstract = {This paper discusses vibrotactile feedback in digital musical instruments. It compares the availability of intrinsic vibrotactile feedback in traditional acoustic musical instruments with the lack of vibrotactile feedback in most digital musical instruments. A short description of human sensory ability with regard to this form of feedback is given and the usefullness of vibrotactile feedback to musical performers is also briefly discussed. A number of devices are examined which can be used to provide vibrotactile feedback in a digital musical instruments and some experiments to evaluate these devices are also described. Finally, examples are given of a number of instruments which make use of some of these devices to provide vibrotactile feedback to the performer.},

@article{Sinclair2014,
abstract = {With real-time models of friction that take velocity as input, accuracy depends in great part on adequately estimating velocity from position measurements. This process can be sensitive to noise, especially at high sampling rates. In audio-haptic acoustic simulations, often characterized by friction-induced, relaxation-type stick-slip oscillations, this gives a gritty, dry haptic feel and a raspy, unnatural sound. Numerous techniques have been proposed, but each depend on tuning parameters so that they may offer a good trade-off between delay and noise rejection. In an effort to compare fairly, each of thirteen methods considered in the present study was automatically optimized and evaluated; finally a subset of these were compared subjectively. Results suggest that no one method is ideal for all gain levels, though the best general performance was found by using a sliding-mode differentiator as input to a Kalman integrator. An additional conclusion is that estimators do not approach the quality available in physical velocity transduction, and therefore such sensors should be considered in haptic device design.},

abstract = {We investigate how to link a physically-based digital sound synthesis structure to a haptic interface for constructing flex- ible and dynamic virtual audio-tactile environments andmu- sical instruments. OurBlock-based PhysicalModel (BBPM) imposes physicality on the audio signals by transforming them to a variable pair of effort and flow. With this pair, we can define the notions of energy and impedance/admittance for object blocks, and manage their physically-based inter- action by using special elements we call nodes. We have recently ported a subset of the BBPM environment to Pure- Data (PD), where we can construct dynamic audio environ- ments akin to a scene graph. Moreover, we can connect off- the-shelf haptic controllers to the entry node of a BBPM, excite the model with one physical variable, provide haptic feedbackwith the dual variable, and concurrently synthesize audio. We will demonstrate this system with two prototypes during the HAID'08Workshop.},

abstract = {A tool for the multisensory stylus-based exploration of virtual textures was used to investigate how different feedback modalities (static or dynamically deformed images, vibration, sound) affect exploratory gestures. To this end, we ran an experiment where participants had to steer a path with the stylus through a curved corridor on the surface of a graphic tablet/display, and we measured steering time, dispersion of trajectories, and applied force. Despite the variety of subjective impressions elicited by the different feedback conditions, we found that only nonvisual feedback induced significant variations in trajectories and an increase in movement time. In a post-experiment, using a paper-and-wood physical realization of the same texture, we recorded a variety of gestural behaviors markedly different from those found with the virtual texture. With the physical setup, movement time was shorter and texture-dependent lateral accelerations could be observed. This work highlights the limits of multisensory pseudo-haptic techniques in the exploration of surface textures.},

Our tactile display is composed of two rotating ec- centric mass actuators driven by a PWM signal generated from an Arduino microcontroller. We conducted physical measurements using an accelerometer and two user-based studies in order to evaluate: intensity and spectral peak fre- quency as function of duty cycle, as well as perceptual vi- brotactile absolute and differential threshold. Results, ob- tained through the use of a logit regression model, provide us with precise design guidelines. These guidelines will enable us to ensure robust perceptual discrimination be- tween vibrotactile stimuli at different intensities. Among with other characterizations presented in this study, these guidelines will allow us to better design tactile cues for our notification system for live-electronics performance.},

A survey of current software solutions for creating haptic virtual environments is provided, with a discussion on the need to integrate such a platform with currently accepted solutions for audio research. A system was developed to combine a haptic programming library with a physical dy- namics engine and to expose its functionality through the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol, an increasingly accepted standard for communication within the audio software and hardware domain. Using OSC messaging, simple 3D objects can be instantiated and constraints on their movement can be specified, allowing the description of physically dy- namic mechanisms. Collision events as well as properties of the objects can be transmitted to the audio system continually to be used for modulating audio synthesis parameters. Some examples of simple virtual musical instruments created with the aid of this system are provided.},

Haptic feedback is rendered via a PhantomR physically-based audiomodel of impact, in which the colliding objects are described as modal resonators that interact through a non-linear impact force. The impact force can be controlled through a stiffness parameter, that influences the contact time of the impact. Previous studies have already indicated that this parameter has a major influence on the au- ditory perception of hardness/stiffness. In the experiment subjects had to tap on virtual surfaces, and were presented with audio-haptic feed- back. In each condition the haptic stiffness had the same value while the acoustic stiffness was varied. Perceived stiffness was determined us- ing an absolute magnitude-estimation procedure: subjects were asked to rate the surfaces on an ordered scale of verbal labels, based on their per- ceived stiffness. The results indicate that subjects consistently ranked the surfaces according to the auditory stimuli.  OmniTM device, while auditory stimuli are obtained using a},
